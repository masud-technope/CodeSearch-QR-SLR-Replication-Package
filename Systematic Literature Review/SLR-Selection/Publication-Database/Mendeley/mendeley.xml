However, designing a query that can accurately retrieve the relevant software artifacts can be challenging for developers as it requires a certain level of knowledge and experience regarding the code base. This paper demonstrates how the difficulty of designing a proper query can be alleviated through automatic Query Reformulation (QR) - an under-the-hood operation for reformulating a user's query with no additional input from the user. The proposed QR framework works by enriching a user's search query with certain specific additional terms drawn from the highest-ranked artifacts retrieved in response to the initial query. The important point here is that these additional terms injected into a query are those that are deemed to be &amp;#x201C;close&amp;#x201D; to the original query terms in the source code on the basis of positional proximity. This similarity metric is based on the notion that terms that deal with the same concepts in source code are usually proximal to one another in the same files. We demonstrate the superiority of our QR framework in relation to the QR frameworks well-known in the natural language document retrieval by showing significant improvements in bug localization performance for two large software projects using more than 4,000 queries.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haiduc, Sonia</author><author>De Rosa, Giuseppe</author><author>Bavota, Gabriele</author><author>Oliveto, Rocco</author><author>De Lucia, Andrea</author><author>Marcus, Andrian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Query quality prediction and reformulation for source code search: The Refoqus tool</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>1307-1310</pages><keywords><keyword>Query Quality</keyword><keyword>Query Reformulation</keyword><keyword>Source Code Search</keyword><keyword>Text Retrieval</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>9781467330763</isbn><accession-num>1321</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606704</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Developers search source code frequently during their daily tasks, to find pieces of code to reuse, to find where to implement changes, etc. Code search based on text retrieval (TR) techniques has been widely used in the software engineering community during the past decade.

The effectiveness of source code search not only relies on the search technique, but also on the quality of the query. In practice, software systems are large, thus it is difficult for a developer to format an accurate query to express what really in her/his mind, especially when the maintainer and the original developer are not the same person. When a query performs poorly, it has to be reformulated. But the words used in a query may be different from those that have similar semantics in the source code, i.e., the synonyms, which will affect the accuracy of code search results. To address this issue, we propose an approach that extends a query with synonyms generated from WordNet. Our approach extracts natural language phrases from source code identifiers, matches expanded queries with these phrases, and sorts the search results. It allows developers to explore word usage in a piece of software, helps them quickly identify relevant program elements for investigation or quickly recognize alternative words for query reformulation. Our initial empirical study on search tasks performed on the JavaScript/ECMAScript interpreter and compiler, Rhino, shows that the synonyms used to expand the queries help recommend good alternative queries. Our approach also improves the precision and recall of Conquer, a state-of-the-art query expansion/reformulation technique, by 5% and 8% respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ge, Xi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dictionary-Based Query Recommendation for Local Code Search</title><secondary-title>SPLASH Student Competition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SPLASH Student Competition</full-title></periodical><pages>103-104</pages><keywords><keyword>ide</keyword><keyword>navigation</keyword><keyword>recommender</keyword><keyword>search</keyword><keyword>tool</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>978-1-4503-1995-9</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/2508075.2508089</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Local code search tools help developers efficiently find code snippets in the code base under development.

An issue that affects code search is the vocabulary mismatch problem: while searching for a particular function, users have to guess the exact words that were chosen by original developers to name code entities. In this paper we present an automatic query expansion ({AQE}) approach that uses word relations to increase the chances of finding relevant code. The approach is applied on top of Test-Driven Code Search ({TDCS}), a promising code retrieval technique that uses test cases as inputs to formulate the search query, but can also be used with other techniques that handle interface definitions to produce queries (interface-driven code search). Since these techniques rely on keywords and types, the vocabulary mismatch problem is also relevant. {AQE} is carried out by leveraging {WordNet}, a type thesaurus for expanding types, and another thesaurus containing only software-related word relations. Our approach is general but was specifically designed for non-native English speakers, who are frequently unaware of the most common terms used to name functions in software. Our evaluation with 36 non-native subjects - including developers and senior Computer Science students - provides evidence that our approach can improve the chances of finding relevant functions by 41% (recall improvement of 30%, on average), without hurting precision.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ge, Xi</author><author>Shepherd, David</author><author>Damcvski, Kostadin</author><author>Murphy-Hill, Emerson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How developers use multi-recommendation system in local code search</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing, VL/HCC</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing, VL/HCC</full-title></periodical><pages>69-76</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>9781479940356</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/VLHCC.2014.6883025</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Developers often start programming tasks by searching for relevant code in their local codebase.

Source code search tools match a developer's keyword-style or natural language query with comments and identifiers in the source code to identify relevant methods that may need to be changed or understood to complete the maintenance task. In this search process, the developer faces a number of challenges: (1) formulating a query, (2) determining if the results are relevant, and (3) if the results are not relevant, reformulating the query. In this paper, we present a NL-based results view for searching source code for maintenance that helps address these challenges by integrating multiple feedback mechanisms into the search results view: prevalence of the query words in the result set, results grouped by NL-based information, as a result list, and suggested alternative query words. Our search technique is implemented as an Eclipse plug-in, CONQUER, and has been empirically validated by 18 Java developers. Our results show that users prefer CONQUER over a state of the art search technique, requesting customization of the interface in future query reformulation techniques.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Datta, Deepanwita</author><author>Varma, Shubham</author><author>Chowdary, C.

Usually, images are accompanied by text caption along with associated documents describing the image. Textual query expansion as a form of enhancing image retrieval is a relatively less explored area. In this paper, we first study the effect of expanding textual query on both image and its associated text retrieval. Our study reveals that judicious expansion of textual query through keyphrase extraction can lead to better results, either in terms of text-retrieval or both image and text-retrieval. To establish this, we use two well-known keyphrase extraction techniques based on tf-idf and KEA. While query expansion results in increased retrieval efficiency, it is imperative that the expansion be semantically justified. So, we propose a graph-based keyphrase extraction model that captures the relatedness between words in terms of both mutual information and relevance feedback. Most of the existing works have stressed on bridging the semantic gap by using textual and visual features, either in combination or individually. The way these text and image features are combined determines the efficacy of any retrieval. For this purpose, we adopt Fisher-LDA to adjudge the appropriate weights for each modality. This provides us with an intelligent decision-making process favoring the feature set to be infused into the final query. Our proposed algorithm is shown to supersede the previously mentioned keyphrase extraction algorithms for query expansion significantly. A rigorous set of experiments performed on ImageCLEF-2011 Wikipedia Retrieval task dataset validates our claim that capturing the semantic relation between words through Mutual Information followed by expansion of a textual query using relevance feedback can simultaneously enhance both text and image retrieval.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahman, Mohammad Masudur</author><author>Roy, Chanchal K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>STRICT: Information retrieval based search term identification for concept location</title><secondary-title>SANER 2017 - 24th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SANER 2017 - 24th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering</full-title></periodical><pages>79-90</pages><keywords><keyword>Concept location</keyword><keyword>POSRank</keyword><keyword>TextRank</keyword><keyword>information retrieval</keyword><keyword>search term identification</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>9781509055012</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SANER.2017.7884611</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>¬© 2017 IEEE. During maintenance, software developers deal with numerous change requests that are written in an unstructured fashion using natural language. Such natural language texts illustrate the change requirement involving various domain related concepts. Software developers need to find appropriate search terms from those concepts so that they could locate the possible locations in the source code using a search technique. Once such locations are identified, they can implement the requested changes there. Studies suggest that developers often perform poorly in coming up with good search terms for a change task. In this paper, we propose a novel technique-STRICT-that automatically identifies suitable search terms for a software change task by analyzing its task description using two information retrieval (IR) techniques-TextRank and POSRank. These IR techniques determine a term's importance based on not only its co-occurrences with other important terms but also its syntactic relationships with them. Experiments using 1,939 change requests from eight subject systems report that STRICT can identify better quality search terms than baseline terms from 52%-62% of the requests with 30%-57% Top-10 retrieval accuracy which are promising. Comparison with two state-of-the-art techniques not only validates our empirical findings and but also demonstrates the superiority of our technique.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ge, Xi</author><author>Shepherd, David C.</author><author>Damevski, Kostadin</author><author>Murphy-Hill, Emerson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design and evaluation of a multi-recommendation system for local code search</title><secondary-title>Journal of Visual Languages and Computing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Visual Languages and Computing</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>39</volume><keywords><keyword>Code search</keyword><keyword>Field study</keyword><keyword>Recommender systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>16171381</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvlc.2016.07.002</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Searching for relevant code in the local code base is a common activity during software maintenance.

We first motivate our technique using an exploratory study with 11 core Java packages and 344K Java posts from Stack Overflow. Experiments using 150 code search queries randomly chosen from three Java tutorial sites show that our technique recommends correct API classes within the top 10 results for about 79% of the queries which is highly promising.

As previous research and a small exploratory study that we conducted show, developers perform poorly in identifying good search terms and therefore waste a lot of time querying and exploring irrelevant code. To support developers in this step, we present an approach to automatically identify good search terms. Based on existing work and an analysis of change tasks, we derived heuristics, determined their relevancy and used the results to develop our approach. For a preliminary evaluation, we conducted a study with ten developers working on open source change tasks. Our approach was able to identify good search terms for all tasks and outperformed the searches of the participants, illustrating the potential of our approach. In addition, since the used heuristics are solely based on textual features of change tasks, our approach is easy and generally applicable and can leverage much of the existing work on feature location.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strzalkowski, Tomek</author><author>Wang, Jin</author><author>Wise, Bowden</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Summarization-based query expansion in information retrieval</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 36th annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics  -</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 36th annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics  -</full-title></periodical><pages>1258-1264</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3115/980691.980774</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=980691.980774</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We discuss a seml-interactive approach to infor-mation retrieval which consists of two tasks per-formed in a sequence.

Recent findings from a user study suggest that IR-based bug localization techniques do not perform well if the bug report lacks rich structured information such as relevant program entity names. On the contrary excessive structured information such as stack traces in the bug report might always not be helpful for the automated bug localization. In this paper, we conduct a large empirical study using 5,500 bug reports from eight subject systems and replicating three existing studies from the literature. Our findings (1) empirically demonstrate how quality dynamics of bug reports affect the performances of IR-based bug localization, and (2) suggest potential ways (e.g., query reformulations) to overcome such limitations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nie, Liming</author><author>Jiang, He</author><author>Ren, Zhilei</author><author>Sun, Zeyi</author><author>Li, Xiaochen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Query Expansion Based on Crowd Knowledge for Code Search</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</full-title></periodical><pages>771-783</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Code search</keyword><keyword>crowd knowledge</keyword><keyword>information retrieval</keyword><keyword>query expansion</keyword><keyword>question &amp; answer pair</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1939-1374 VO - 9</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TSC.2016.2560165</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>As code search is a frequent developer activity in software development practices, improving the performance of code search is a critical task. In the text retrieval based search techniques employed in the code search, the term mismatch problem is a critical language issue for retrieval effectiveness. By reformulating the queries, query expansion provides effective ways to solve the term mismatch problem. In this paper, we propose Query Expansion based on Crowd Knowledge (QECK), a novel technique to improve the performance of code search algorithms. QECK identifies software-specific expansion words from the high quality pseudo relevance feedback question and answer pairs on Stack Overflow to automatically generate the expansion queries. Furthermore, we incorporate QECK in the classic Rocchio's model, and propose QECK based code search method QECKRocchio. We conduct three experiments to evaluate our QECK technique and investigate QECKRocchio in a large-scale corpus containing real-world code snippets and a question and answer pair collection. The results show that QECK improves the performance of three code search algorithms by up to 64 percent in Precision, and 35 percent in NDCG. Meanwhile, compared with the state-of-the-art query expansion method, the improvement of QECKRocchio is 22 percent in Precision, and 16 percent in NDCG. ¬© 2016 IEEE.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Panchenko, Oleksandr</author><author>Karstens, Jan</author><author>Plattner, Hasso</author><author>Zeier, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Precise and scalable querying of syntactical source code patterns using sample code snippets and a database</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Conference on Program Comprehension</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE International Conference on Program Comprehension</full-title></periodical><pages>41-50</pages><keywords><keyword>XPath</keyword><keyword>abstract syntax trees</keyword><keyword>database</keyword><keyword>query-by-example</keyword><keyword>source code query language</keyword><keyword>source code search</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>9780769543987</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICPC.2011.31</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>While analyzing a log file of a text-based source code search engine we discovered that developers search for fine-grained syntactical patterns in 36\&amp;#x025; of queries.

One possibility of improving code search is the utilization of structural information in form of abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, developers usually work with the textual representation of source code and, thus, have difficulties in expressing their queries as fragments of abstract syntax trees and in interpreting the results. This paper addresses assistance of query composition and search result visualization. Query formulation is considered to be an iterative process. After one query is run, the AST vertices neighbored to the result vertices are analyzed to propose refinement options for the next query. Search results are visualized in a tree view which aggregates all matches in a compact way instead of showing a small number of ranked matches.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haiduc, Sonia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Supporting query formulation for text retrieval applications in software engineering</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 30th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2014</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - 30th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2014</full-title></periodical><pages>657-662</pages><keywords><keyword>query</keyword><keyword>query quality</keyword><keyword>query reformulation</keyword><keyword>text retrieval</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>9780769553030</isbn><accession-num>1282374</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICSME.2014.117</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Text Retrieval ({TR}) techniques have been successfully used to leverage the textual information found in software artifacts with the purpose of aiding developers with their daily tasks. {TR} techniques require a query as input and the usefulness of the results they retrieve depends greatly on this query. While some queries retrieve relevant information for the current task, others do not, therefore pointing developers in the wrong direction. Developers have a hard time realizing this before going through the search results, which, in the case of &quot;bad&quot; queries means time and effort lost looking at irrelevant information. In this scenario, developers have to reformulate the query, often without pointers on how to improve it. The work presented in this paper introduces novel approaches to address these challenges and makes two main contributions: 1) defines the first approach for predicting the success of a {TR} query in the context of {SE} tasks, 2) introduces automatic approaches that analyze a query and improve it by finding the most suited reformulation for it. The approaches were evaluated for the task of concept location in source code and the results of the performed studies reveal their usefulness.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tao, Zhao Yang</author><author>Yi, Yang Hua</author><author>Xu, Qian Zhi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Studies on the chemical constituents of Uncaria yunanensis Hsia.

Multimodal Retrieval provides new paradigms and methods aimed at effectively searching through the enormous volume of data. Multimodal retrieval is a well studied problem often used in image retrieval. Most of the existing works in image retrieval under the pretext of multimodality stress on bridging the semantic gap by using both textual and visual features. In this paper, we use relevance feedback from the user-generated documents associated with the images for expanding textual query and study its effect on both image and text retrieval. We employ a topic decomposition based keyphrase extraction technique to expand the textual queries. Our results articulate the fact that an insightful textual query expansion always improves retrieval performance for both textual or image retrieval. Also, we adopt optimum weight learning scheme to combine the modalities in a privileged way. We perform a comparative study with two well established keyphrase extraction techniques which are used for textual query expansion.

As a part of this, they often formulate an initial query from the request texts, and then attempt to map the concepts discussed in the request to relevant source code locations in the software system (a.k.a., concept location). Unfortunately, studies suggest that they often perform poorly in choosing the right search terms for a change task. In this paper, we propose a novel technique ‚ÄìACER‚Äì that takes an initial query, identifies appropriate search terms from the source code using a novel term weight ‚ÄìCodeRank, and then suggests effective reformulation to the initial query by exploiting the source document structures, query quality analysis and machine learning.

Context: Since the mid-2000s, numerous recommendation systems based on text retrieval (TR) have been proposed to support software engineering (SE) tasks such as concept location, traceability link recovery, code reuse, impact analysis, and so on. The success of TR-based solutions highly depends on the query submitted, which is either formulated by the developer or automatically extracted from software artifacts. Aim: We aim at predicting the quality of queries submitted to TR-based approaches in SE. This can lead to benefits for developers and for the quality of software systems alike. For example, knowing when a query is poorly formulated can save developers the time and frustration of analyzing irrelevant search results. Instead, they could focus on reformulating the query. Also, knowing if an artifact used as a query leads to irrelevant search results may uncover underlying problems in the query artifact itself. Method: We introduce an automatic query quality prediction approach for software artifact retrieval by adapting NL-inspired solutions to their use on software data. We present two applications and evaluations of the approach in the context of concept location and traceability link recovery, where TR has been applied most often in SE. For concept location, we use the approach to determine if the list of retrieved code elements is likely to contain code relevant to a particular change request or not, in which case, the queries are good candidates for reformulation. For traceability link recovery, the queries represent software artifacts. In this case, we use the query quality prediction approach to identify artifacts that are hard to trace to other artifacts and may therefore have a low intrinsic quality for TR-based traceability link recovery. Results: For concept location, the evaluation shows that our approach is able to correctly predict the quality of queries in 82% of the cases, on average, using very little training data. In the case of traceability recovery, the proposed approach is able to detect hard to trace artifacts in 74% of the cases, on average. Conclusions: The results of our evaluation on applications for concept location and traceability link recovery indicate that our approach can be used to predict the results of a TR-based approach by assessing the quality of the text query. This can lead to saved effort and time, as well as the identification of software artifacts that may be difficult to trace using TR.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahman, Mohammad Masudur and Roy, Chanchal K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QUICKAR : Automatic Query Reformulation for Concept Location using Crowdsourced Knowledge</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering - ASE 2016</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering - ASE 2016</full-title></periodical><pages>220-225</pages><keywords><keyword>adjacency list</keyword><keyword>crowdsourced knowledge</keyword><keyword>evance</keyword><keyword>query reformulation</keyword><keyword>semantic rel-</keyword><keyword>stack overflow</keyword><keyword>word co-occurrence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>9781450338455</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/2970276.2970362</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>During maintenance, software developers deal with numerous change requests made by the users of a software system.

Despite the importance of FL, the vast majority of work has been focused on retrieving code, whereas other software artifacts such as the models have been neglected. Furthermore, locating a piece of information from a query in a large repository is a challenging task as it requires knowledge of the vocabulary used in the software artifacts. This can be alleviated by automatically reformulating the query (adding or removing terms). In this paper, we test four existing query reformulation techniques, which perform the best for FL in code but have never been used for FL in models. Specifically, we test these techniques in two industrial domains: a model-based family of firmwares for induction hobs, and a model-based family of PLC software to control trains. We compare the results provided by our FL approach using the query and the reformulated queries by means of statistical analysis. Our results show that reformulated queries do not improve the performance in models, which could lead towards a new direction in the creation or reconsideration of these techniques to be applied in models.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alromima, Waseem</author><author>Moawad, Ibrahim F</author><author>Elgohary, Rania</author><author>Aref, Mostafa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ontology-based Query Expansion for Arabic Text Retrieval</title><secondary-title>(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>223-230</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>5</keyword><keyword>a challenges that are</keyword><keyword>arabic ontology</keyword><keyword>arabic quran corpus</keyword><keyword>but constructing awn presents</keyword><keyword>include the scripts and</keyword><keyword>information retrieval</keyword><keyword>search</keyword><keyword>semantic</keyword><keyword>semitic</keyword><keyword>the morphological properties of</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><urls/><abstract>In this paper, we present a SVM multi-classification decision-tree optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) in order to overcome the defect of the error accumulation which is caused by the fixed tree configuration of traditional support vector machine (SVM) multi-classification decision-tree algorithms and the random positions of their decision nodes.

Present-day source code search engines, such as Google Code Search, tend to treat source code as pure text, as they do with web pages. However, source code files differ from web pages or pure text files in that each file may contain certain blocks expressing different functions. Developers use API-statements to complete functions within a source file and use comments to indicate the meaning of each function. In this paper, we segment source code files into two types of block, code-data block and metadata block, that possess different stemming and stop word filtering processes used in building the source code index. Finally, we propose an auto block-specified query processing approach to assist users in searching for specific code block within a source file. Experimental results indicate that our approach provides a more flexible source code search mechanism that allows a greater number of relevant items to be found.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wedyan, Mohammad</author><author>Alhadidi, Basim</author><author>Alrabea, Adnan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of using a thesaurus in Arabic information retrieval system</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI)</full-title></periodical><pages>431-435</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>any retrieval system is</keyword><keyword>arabic retrieval</keyword><keyword>efficiency and effectiveness</keyword><keyword>indexing</keyword><keyword>information retrieval system</keyword><keyword>its</keyword><keyword>of</keyword><keyword>stop words</keyword><keyword>there are two aspects</keyword><keyword>thesaurus</keyword><keyword>usually evaluated according to</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>978-1-4419-1427-9</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-1-4419-1428-6_227</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Automatic query expansion methods for English and other languages text retrieval have been studied for a long time.

Keyword extraction is an important technology in many areas of document processing, such as text clustering, text summarization, and text retrieval. This paper provides a keyword extraction algorithm based on WordNet and PageRank. Firstly, a text is represented as a rough undirected weighted semantic graph with WordNet, which defines synsets as vertices and relations of vertices as edges, and assigns the weight of edges with the relatedness of connected synsets. Then we apply UW-PageRank in the rough graph to do word sense disambiguation, prune the graph, and finally apply UW-PageRank again on the pruned graph to extract keywords. The experimental results show our algorithm is practical and effective.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Gareth</author><author>Sakai, Tetsuya</author><author>Kajiura, Masahiro</author><author>Sumita, Kazuo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incremental relevance feedback in Japanese text retrieval</title><secondary-title>Information Retrieval</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Retrieval</full-title></periodical><pages>361-384</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Incremental relevance feedback</keyword><keyword>Japanese text</keyword><keyword>Number-to-view graphs</keyword><keyword>Probabilistic retrieval</keyword><keyword>Query expansion</keyword><keyword>Term reweighting</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1009932512781</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The application of relevance feedback techniques has been shown to improve retrieval performance for a number of information retrieval tasks. This paper explores incremental relevance feedback for ad hoc Japanese text retrieval; examining, separately and in combination, the utility of term reweighting and query expansion using a probabilistic retrieval model. Retrieval performance is evaluated in terms of standard precision-recall measures, and also using  number-to-view graphs. Experimental results, on the standard BMIR-J2 Japanese language retrieval collection, show that both term reweighting and query expansion improve retrieval performance. This is reflected in improvements in both precision and recall, but also a reduction in the average number of documents which must be viewed to find a selected number of relevant items. In particular, using a simple simulation of user searching, incremental application of relevance information is shown to lead to progressively improved retrieval performance and an overall reduction in the number of documents that a user must view to find relevant ones.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Ben</author><author>Ounis, Iadh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining fields for query expansion and adaptive query expansion</title><secondary-title>Information Processing and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Processing and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1294-1307</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Adaptive query expansion</keyword><keyword>External expansion</keyword><keyword>Information retrieval</keyword><keyword>Pseudo relevance feedback</keyword><keyword>Query expansion on fields</keyword><keyword>TREC experiments</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0031-9384 (Print)\r0031-9384 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>15178147</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ipm.2006.11.002</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In this paper, we aim to improve query expansion for ad-hoc retrieval, by proposing a more fine-grained term reweighting process. This fine-grained process uses statistics from the representation of documents in various fields, such as their titles, the anchor text of their incoming links, and their body content. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we propose a novel query expansion mechanism on fields by combining field evidence available in a corpora. Second, we propose an adaptive query expansion mechanism that selects an appropriate collection resource, either the local collection, or a high-quality external resource, for query expansion on a per-query basis. The two proposed query expansion approaches are thoroughly evaluated using two standard Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Web collections, namely the WT10G collection and the large-scale .GOV2 collection. From the experimental results, we observe a statistically significant improvement compared with the baselines. Moreover, we conclude that the adaptive query expansion mechanism is very effective when the external collection used is much larger than the local collection. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Advances in web search effectiveness are therefore perhaps the most significant public outcomes of IR research. Query expansion is one such method for improving the effectiveness of ranked retrieval by adding additional terms to a query. In previous approaches to query expansion, the additional terms are selected from highly ranked documents returned from an initial retrieval run. We propose a new method of obtaining expansion terms, based on selecting terms from past user queries that are associated with documents in the collection. Our scheme is effective for query expansion for web retrieval: our results show relative improvements over unexpanded full text retrieval of 26%--29%, and 18%--20% over an optimised, conventional expansion approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Broschart, Andreas</author><author>Schenkel, Ralf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Novel Hybrid Index Structure for Efficient Text Retrieval</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 34th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 34th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval</full-title></periodical><pages>1175-1176</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>978-1-4503-0757-4</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/2009916.2010106</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Query processing with precomputed term pair lists can improve efficiency for some queries, but suffers from the quadratic number of index lists that need to be read.

In the case of an interactive environment, the expansion, which is usually represented as a list of words, is extracted from documents whose relevance is known thanks to the feedback of the user. In this paper we argue that the accuracy of a text retrieval system can be improved if we employ a query expansion method based on a mixed Graph of Terms representation instead of a method based on a simple list of words. The graph, that is composed of a directed and an undirected subgraph, can be automatically extracted from a small set of only relevant documents (namely the user feedback) using a method for term extraction based on the probabilistic Topic Model. The evaluation of the proposed method has been carried out by performing a comparison with two less complex structures: one represented as a set of pairs of words and another that is a simple list of words.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colace, Francesco</author><author>De Santo, Massimo</author><author>Greco, Luca</author><author>Napoletano, Paolo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Weighted Word Pairs for query expansion</title><secondary-title>Information Processing and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Processing and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>179-193</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Explicit relevance feedback</keyword><keyword>Model</keyword><keyword>Probabilistic</keyword><keyword>Pseudo-relevance feedback</keyword><keyword>Query expansion</keyword><keyword>Text retrieval</keyword><keyword>Topic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>9781634391450</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ipm.2014.07.004</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This paper proposes a novel query expansion method to improve accuracy of text retrieval systems.

We enter the evaluation with a new biomedical search engine, developed as an open-source project which relies heavily on MG4J, and is publicly available at http://www.twease.org. We designed our runs to test the features of Twease that most distinguish it from other biomedical search engines. Such features include: (1) a custom biomedical query expansion module (which draws on biomedical thesauri, but also includes a statistical model of morphological word variations observed in the biomedical domain); (2) the ability to search the index simultaneously at the whole document level, or at the sentence level. Our official runs evaluated the performance of minimal interval semantics when used with custom morphological word expansion on a biomedical corpus. Our best official run scored MAP=0.30 at the document level, slightly above the median of other submissions. Our non-official runs compared minimal interval semantics to BM25 on the same topics and corpus. We varied the level of query expansion for both methods, and demonstrated how easily BM25 breaks down as more related terms are added to a query, while minimal interval semantics is robust to such change. We investigated the origin of the issue with a biologically inspired experimental design (mutation recovery). Our results help understand why certain groups observe performance drops with thesaurus-based query expansion, while other groups report the opposite effect. The best of our non-official runs achieves a MAP document level of 0.32 when an intermediate level of query expansion is used. This manuscript also describes our first attempt at passage retrieval in full text articles (we achieved a MAP of 0.052, above the median of 0.028).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Kuang-Hua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating Chinese Text Retrieval with Multilingual Queries</title><secondary-title>Knowledge Organization</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Knowledge Organization</full-title></periodical><pages>156-170</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3/4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><isbn>09437444</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://web.b.ebscohost.com.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=4e564512-2c37-4866-a33e-66ff511fd47a%40sessionmgr105&amp;hid=110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3D%3D#AN=502871494&amp;db=lls</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper reports the design of a Chinese test collection with multilingual queries and the application of this test collection to evaluate information retrieval (IR) systems.

In practice, the index is either document-based or term-based partitioned. This choice is made depending on the properties of the underlying hardware infrastructure, query traffic distribution, and some performance and availability constraints. In query processing on retrieval systems that adopt a term-based index partitioning strategy, the high communication overhead due to the transfer of large amounts of data from the index servers forms a major performance bottleneck, deteriorating the scalability of the entire distributed retrieval system. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel inverted index partitioning model that relies on hypergraph partitioning. In the proposed model, concurrently accessed index entries are assigned to the same index servers, based on the inverted index access patterns extracted from the past query logs. The model aims to minimize the communication overhead that will be incurred by future queries while maintaining the computational load balance among the index servers. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model through extensive experiments using a real-life text collection and a search query sample. Our results show that considerable performance gains can be achieved relative to the term-based index partitioning strategies previously proposed in literature. In most cases, however, the performance remains inferior to that attained by document-based partitioning.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rao, Ashwin</author><author>Lu, Allan</author><author>Meier, Ed</author><author>Ahmed, Salahuddin</author><author>Pliske, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Query processing in trec-6</title><secondary-title>Information Processing and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Processing and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>179-186</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0306-4573(99)00050-3</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Recent improvements in commercial information retrieval systems have focused on query processing as a means to improve the recall and precision of users' queries.

The Internet-scale open source software (OSS) production in various communities are generating abundant reusable resources for software developers. However, how to retrieve and reuse the desired and mature software from huge amounts of candidates is a great challenge: there are usually big gaps between the user application contexts (that often used as queries) and the OSS key words (that often used to match the queries). In this paper, we define the scenario-based query problem for OSS retrieval, and then we propose a novel approach to reformulate the raw query by leveraging the crowd wisdom from millions of developers to improve the retrieval results. We build a software-specific domain lexical database based on the knowledge in open source communities, by which we can expand and optimize the input queries. The experiment results show that, our approach can reformulate the initial query effectively and outperforms other existing search engines significantly at finding mature software.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Zhongyuan</author><author>Li, X</author><author>Yang, Muyun</author><author>Qi, Haoliang</author><author>Li, Sheng</author><author>Zhao, Tiejun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>HIT at TREC 2012 Microblog Track</title><secondary-title>Text REtrieval Conference</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Text REtrieval Conference</full-title></periodical><pages>267-276</pages><keywords><keyword>language model</keyword><keyword>query expansion</keyword><keyword>real-time search</keyword><keyword>tem-</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>9781450311540</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IVS.2004.1336419</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec21/papers/HIT_MTLAB.microblog.final.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper describes our approaches to the TREC 2012 Microblog Track.

We implement this finding to Information Retrieval, as follows. We present a novel automatic query reformulation technique, which is based on shallow syntactic evidence induced from various language samples, and used to enhance the performance of an Information Retrieval system. Firstly, we draw shallow syntactic evidence from language samples of varying size, and compare the effect of language sample size upon retrieval performance, when using our syntactically-based query reformulation (SQR) technique. Secondly, we compare SQR to a state-of-the-art probabilistic pseudo-relevance feedback technique. Additionally, we combine both techniques and evaluate their compatibility. We evaluate our proposed technique across two standard Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) English test collections, and three statistically different weighting models. Experimental results suggest that SQR markedly enhances retrieval performance, and is at least comparable to pseudo-relevance feedback. Notably, the combination of SQR and pseudo-relevance feedback further enhances retrieval performance considerably. These collective experimental results confirm the tenet that high frequency shallow syntactic fragments correspond to content-bearing lexical fragments. ¬© 2007.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lemos, Otavio Augusto Lazzarini</author><author>De Paula, Adriano Carvalho</author><author>Sajnani, Hitesh</author><author>Lopes, Cristina V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can the use of types and query expansion help improve large-scale code search?</title><secondary-title>2015 IEEE 15th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation, SCAM 2015 - Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2015 IEEE 15th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation, SCAM 2015 - Proceedings</full-title></periodical><pages>41-50</pages><keywords><keyword>code search</keyword><keyword>query expansion</keyword><keyword>software reuse</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>9781467375290</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SCAM.2015.7335400</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>With the open source code movement, code search with the intent of reuse has become increasingly popular. So much so that researchers have been calling it the new facet of software reuse. Although code search differs from general-purpose document search in essential ways, most tools still rely mainly on keywords matched against source code text. Recently, researchers have proposed more sophisticated ways to perform code search, such as including interface definitions in the queries (e.g., return and parameter types of the desired function, along with keywords; called here Interface-Driven Code Search-IDCS). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few empirical studies that compare traditional keyword-based code search (KBCS) with more advanced approaches such as IDCS. In this paper we describe an experiment that compares the effectiveness of KBCS with IDCS in the task of large-scale code search of auxiliary functions implemented in Java. We also measure the impact of query expansion based on types and WordNet on both approaches. Our experiment involved 36 subjects that produced real-world queries for 16 different auxiliary functions and a repository with more than 2,000,000 Java methods. Results show that the use of types can improve recall and the number of relevant functions returned (#RFR) when combined with query expansion (‚àº30% improvement in recall, and ‚àº43% improvement in #RFR). However, a more detailed analysis suggests that in some situations it is best to use keywords only, in particular when these are sufficient to semantically define the desired function. ¬© 2015 IEEE.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roldan-Vega, Manuel</author><author>Mallet, Greg</author><author>Hill, Emily</author><author>Fails, Jerry Alan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CONQUER: A tool for NL-based query refinement &amp; contextualizing code search results</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance, ICSM</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance, ICSM</full-title></periodical><pages>512-515</pages><keywords><keyword>Feature location</keyword><keyword>Software maintenance</keyword><keyword>Source code search</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>978-0-7695-4981-1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICSM.2013.84</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Identifying relevant code to perform maintenance or reuse tasks is becoming increasingly difficult. Software systems continue to grow and evolve, and developers often find themselves searching within thousands to even millions of lines of code to identify code relevant to a particular maintenance task. Automated solutions are vital to help developers become more efficient at locating code to be modified when performing maintenance tasks. In order to address this need and help developers reduce the time spent finding and searching for relevant code, we have built an Eclipse-plug in, {CONQUER}, that helps developers identify relevant results by providing critical insight and context of how query words are used in the code. {CONQUER} leverages advanced natural language ({NL}) information in the source code to group, sort and display the results in a meaningful way. In addition, {CONQUER} analyzes the frequency and co-occurrence of words in the method result set to provide alternative phrases that can help further refine the query. This rich contextual hierarchy helps the developer quickly determine if the query is correct and hone in on relevant results. The {NL}-based organization of results reduces the number of relevance judgments the developers need to make, and thus can reduce the overall time for a maintenance task.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Shuang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improve text retrieval effectiveness and robustness</title><secondary-title>PhD Thesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PhD Thesis</full-title></periodical><pages>1-114</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>papers2://publication/uuid/9E0641F7-144E-4447-AE1D-AA41A0EA8D0E</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Retrieval effectiveness and robustness are two of the most important criteria of text retrieval.

As a practical outcome of this research, a communication aid based on message retrieval by key words was designed, implemented and evaluated. The message retrieval module in the system uses a large semantic lexicon, derived from the WordNet database, for query expansion. Trials have been carried out with the device to evaluate whether the approach is suitable for AAC, and to determine the semantic relations that lead to efficient message retrieval. The first part of this paper describes the background of the project and highlights the retrieval requirements for a communication aid, which differ considerably from the requirements in standard text retrieval. We then present the overall design of the WordKeys communication aid and describe the tasks of its sub-modules. We summarise trials that have been carried out to determine the effect of semantic query expansion on the success of message retrieval. Evaluation results show that information about word frequency can solve problems that occurred in the semantic query expansion because of taxonomies that have too many intermediate steps between closely related words. Finally, a user evaluation with the improved system showed that full text retrieval is an effective approach to message access in a communication aid.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perez, Jesus A.

The experimental conditions, variables and constraints in undertaking operational user testing are discussed in relation to the interface features, and in terms of: the visibility of the system's operations; the system/user control; and the cognitive load on the user. It is suggested that the quality and effectiveness of the search interaction for query expansion is dependent on resolving the tension between seemingly opposing interface and functional aspects, e.g. automatic vs interactive query expansion, explicit vs implicit use of a thesaurus, document vs query space.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Renals, S</author><author>Abberley, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The {THISL} {SDR} system at {TREC}--9</title><secondary-title>Proc.

QDE has long been of interest in text retrieval. However, few research works have been conducted in image retrieval. Existing QDE methods in image retrieval mainly explore the statistical characteristics (coherence, specificity, etc.) of the returned images to derive a value for indicating the query difficulty degree. To the best of our knowledge, little research has been done to directly estimate the real search performance, such as average precision. In this paper, we propose a novel query difficulty estimation approach which automatically estimates the average precision of the image search results. Specifically, we first adaptively select a set of query relevant and query irrelevant images for each query via modified pseudo relevance feedback. Then a simple but effective voting scheme and two estimation methods (hard estimation and soft estimation) are proposed to estimate the relevance probability of each image in the search results. Based on the imagesrelevance probabilities, the average precision for each query is derived. The experimental results on two benchmark image search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kando, N.</author><author>Kageura, K.</author><author>Yoshioka, M.</author><author>Oyama, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phrase processing methods for Japanese text retrieval</title><secondary-title>SIGIR Forum (ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SIGIR Forum (ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval)</full-title></periodical><volume>32</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Character-based indexing</keyword><keyword>Japanese text retrieval</keyword><keyword>Phrase processing</keyword><keyword>Word-based query segmentation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/305110.305120</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This paper examines the effectiveness of different phrase identification and weighting methods for Japanese text retrieval in an operational information retrieval (IR) system, called NACSIS-IR.

We design a layered framework based on information retrieval techniques, to provide a usable query interface to the multimedia database. First, we introduce a concept layer to enable reasoning over low-level concepts in the database. Second, we add an evidential reasoning layer as an intermediate between the user and the concept layer. Third, we add the functionality to process the users' relevance feedback. We then adapt the inference network model from text retrieval to an evidential reasoning model for multimedia query processing. We conclude with an outline for implementation of miRRor on top of the Monet extensible database system.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adriani, Mirna</author><author>Van Rijsbergen, C.

I present two experiments that investigate (1) how\ end-users with and without a general background in information \ retrieval use a state-of-the-art, best-match, ranked-output \ information retrieval mechanism interactively to develop effective in\ formation filters for document retrieval from a large scale, full-text\ document collection and (2) how the availability of relevance \ feedback and the level of user knowledge about and the control of the \ output of the relevance feedback mechanism impact user behavior and \ performance. Ten searchers who had a background in IR were observed in\ a first study; 64 complete novices took part in a second experiment \ that systematically varied user knowledge and user control of the \ feedback mechanism. Behavioral and performance data suggest that (1) \ iterative query formulation is a depth-first search process, that (2) \ users with and without a background in information retrieval can, with\ little training, interact effectively with a best-matched, ranke\ d-output IR mechanism, that (3) relevance feedback tends to improve \ performance, and that (4) increased levels of user control over \ relevance feedback shortens the search process while resulting in \ equal or better performance.||}</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Witschel, H.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ranking information resources in peer-to-peer text retrieval: An experimental study</title><secondary-title>International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings</full-title></periodical><pages>75-82</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>9781605582542</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/1458469.1458476</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This paper experimentally studies approaches to the problem of ranking information resources w.r.t. user queries in peer-to-peer information retrieval. In distributed environments, for each given user query and a set of information resources that are available, we need to select the right subset of these resources to forward the query to. Here, we study the problem of pruning descriptions of resources to acceptable lengths in a peer-to-peer scenario and two approaches to overcome the mismatch problem that may arise as a consequence of the pruning, namely query expansion and learning better resource descriptions from query streams. The results show that resource descriptions can be pruned to a large extent without ill effects and that learning better descriptions from query streams works much better than query expansion.

In this work, for these calculations, 11 alternative implementation techniques are presented under four different categories, and their asymptotic time and space complexities are investigated. To our knowledge, six of these techniques are not discussed in any other publication before. Furthermore, analytical experiments are carried out on a 30 GB document collection to evaluate the practical performance of different implementations in terms of query processing time and space consumption. Advantages and disadvantages of each technique are illustrated under different querying scenarios, and several experiments that investigate the scalability of the implementations are presented. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The top 1000 tweets were retrieved from Twitter commercial search en-gine by applying the title of the topic as a query. We exploit pseudo relevance feedback technologies to estimate probabil-ity distributions of each term in the topic, then comparing these probabilities with a background distribution model. We select the highest different terms as our expanded query terms. We then generate a vector for each topic, the features of the vector are non-stop word title terms, selected narra-tive terms and query expansion terms. Different weights are assigned to the different types of terms. Since we are allowed to deliver at most 10 tweets every day, and the la-tency time can not exceed 100 minutes, we solve the tweet notification scenario as a multiple-choice secretary problem. Two different solutions were tested.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aleahmad, Aholfazl</author><author>Hakimian, Parsia</author><author>Mahdikhani, Farzad</author><author>Oroumchian, Farhad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>N-gram and local context analysis for Persian text retrieval</title><secondary-title>2007 9th International Symposium on Signal Processing and its Applications, ISSPA 2007, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2007 9th International Symposium on Signal Processing and its Applications, ISSPA 2007, Proceedings</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>1424407796</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ISSPA.2007.4555345</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The Persian language is one of the languages in Middle-East, so there are significant amount of Persian documents available on the Web.

The approach applies fuzzy clustering to obtain a classification of multilingual keywords by concepts. A multilingual concept directory is developed by labeling each concept with native language of the target user and associating it with relevant multilingual documents. The directory works as a searching interface for document browsing. This explorative approach is particularly suitable for casual users to search with Asian languages by avoiding the trouble of query formulation and input in MLTR. For the general application of MLTR, an explorative interface is also advisable when the user has only a vague idea of the domain to be searched.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hancock-Beaulieu, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interactive query expansion in an OPAC: interface and retrieval issues</title><secondary-title>Journal of Document and Text Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Document and Text Management</full-title></periodical><volume>2</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1994</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url></url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Reports on the evaluation of interactive query expansion in an online library catalogue using the Okapi prototype text retrieval software.

INEX has focused on how to express the user needs through topics that may involve structural XML elements. How such user needs can be translated into XML queries has an impact on the requirements for an XML-search language. The analysis in this paper shows that the W3C requirements for extending XQuery and XPath with full-text search seem to address most of the needs identified through our first experiments with INEX.

In addition to a list of search results, I3 provides support for developers during browsing and inspecting the retrieved code entities. In situ visualizations augment results and source code with additional information relevant for further exploration. Developers are able to retrieve details on the textual similarity of a source code entity to the search query and to other entities, as well as the information on co-changed entities from a project's history. Execution traces recorded during program runs can be used as filters to further refine the search results. We implemented I3 as an Eclipse plug-in and tested it in a user study involving 18 students and professional developers that were asked to perform three feature location tasks chosen from the issue tracking system of jEdit. The results of our study suggest that I3's user interface is intuitive and unobtrusively supports developers with the required information when and where they need it.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amati, Giambattista</author><author>Carpineto, Claudio</author><author>Romano, Giovanni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fondazione ugo bordoni at trec 2004</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Thirteenth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2004)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the Thirteenth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2004)</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec13/papers/fub.robust.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Our participation in TREC 2004 aims to extend and improve the use\nof the DFR (Divergence From Randomness) models with Query Expansion\n(QE) for the robust track.

A group of 26 subjects searched for four Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) topics using automatic and interactive query expansion based on relevance feedback. The TREC- and user-suggested pools of relevant documents were reassessed on a four-level relevance scale. The results show that the users could identify nearly all highly relevant documents and about half of the marginal ones. Users also selected a fair number of irrelevant documents for query expansion. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of query expansion is closely related to the searchers' success in retrieving and identifying highly relevant documents for feedback. The implications of the results on interpreting the findings of past experiments with liberal relevance thresholds are also discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahman, Md Mahmudur</author><author>Bhattacharya, Prabir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Image retrieval with automatic query expansion based on local analysis in a semantical concept feature space</title><secondary-title>Proceeding of the ACM International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval - CIVR '09</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceeding of the ACM International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval - CIVR '09</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>9781605584805</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/1646396.1646422</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1646396.1646422</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We present an automatic query expansion approach by generalizing the vector space model of information retrieval. In this framework, the images are presented by vectors of weighted concepts similar to the keyword-based representation in the text retrieval domain. The concepts comprise of color and texture patches from local image regions in a multi-dimensional feature space. To generate the concept vocabularies and represent the images, statistical model is built by utilizing a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classification technique. For automatic query expansion, the correlations between concepts are analyzed based on the neighborhood proximity between the concepts in encoded images by considering the local feedback information. The experimental results on a photographic image collection demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed query expansion approaches.

In the case of an interactive environment, the expansion, which is usually represented as a list of words, is extracted from documents whose relevance is known thanks to the feedback of the user. In this paper we argue that the accuracy of a text retrieval system can be improved if we employ a query expansion method based on a mixed Graph of Terms representation instead of a method based on a simple list of words. The graph, that is composed of a directed and an undirected subgraph, can be automatically extracted from a small set of only relevant documents (namely the user feedback) using a method for term extraction based on the probabilistic Topic Model. The evaluation of the proposed method has been carried out by performing a comparison with two less complex structures: one represented as a set of pairs of words and another that is a simple list of words.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grehn, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congenital glaucoma surgery: A neglected field in ophthalmology?</title><secondary-title>British Journal of Ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British Journal of Ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-2</pages><volume>92</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>978-1-4244-8630-4</isbn><accession-num>18156369</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/bjo.2007.126458</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Concept location is the process of locating relevant source code fragments where a change must be made.

Advances in web search effectiveness are therefore perhaps the most significant public outcomes of IR research. Query expansion is one such method for improving the effectiveness of ranked retrieval by adding additional terms to a query. In previous approaches to query expansion, the additional terms are selected from highly ranked documents returned from an initial retrieval run. We propose a new method of obtaining expansion terms, based on selecting terms from past user queries that are associated with documents in the collection. Our scheme is effective for query expansion for web retrieval: our results show relative improvements over unexpanded full text retrieval of 26%--29%, and 18%--20% over an optimised, conventional expansion approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skopal, Tom√°≈°</author><author>Moravec, Pavel</author><author>Pokorn√Ω, Jaroslav</author><author>Sn√°≈°el, V√°clav</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metric indexing for the vector model in Text Retrieval</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</full-title></periodical><pages>183-195</pages><volume>3246</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>0042-4900 (Print)\r0042-4900 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>18156598</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-540-30213-1_26</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In the area of Text Retrieval, processing a query in the vector model has been verified to be qualitatively more effective than searching in the boolean model.

In this paper we propose a method of vector query processing based on metric indexing, which is efficient especially for the LSI model.

Question answering (QA) systems often perform information re-trieval at an initial stage. Information re-trieval (IR) performance, provided by en-gines such as Lucene, places a bound on overall system performance. For example, no answer bearing documents are retrieved at low ranks for almost 40% of questions. In this paper, answer texts from previous QA evaluations held as part of the Text REtrieval Conferences (TREC) are paired with queries and analysed in an attempt to identify performance-enhancing words. These words are then used to evaluate the performance of a query expansion method. Data driven extension words were found to help in over 70% of difficult questions. These words can be used to improve and evaluate query expansion methods. Sim-ple blind relevance feedback (RF) was cor-rectly predicted as unlikely to help overall performance, and an possible explanation is provided for its low value in IR for QA.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Natsev, Apostol (Paul)</author><author>Haubold, Alexander</author><author>Te≈°iƒá, Jelena</author><author>Xie, Lexing</author><author>Yan, Rong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Semantic concept-based query expansion and re-ranking for multimedia retrieval</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Multimedia  - MULTIMEDIA '07</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Multimedia  - MULTIMEDIA '07</full-title></periodical><pages>991</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>9781595937025</isbn><accession-num>19367182</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/1291233.1291448</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1291233.1291448</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We study the problem of semantic concept-based query expansion and re-ranking for multimedia retrieval. In particular, we explore the utility of a fixed lexicon of visual semantic concepts for automatic multimedia retrieval and re-ranking purposes. In this paper, we propose several new approaches for query expansion, in which textual keywords, visual examples, or initial retrieval results are analyzed to identify the most relevant visual concepts for the given query. These concepts are then used to generate additional query results and/or to re-rank an existing set of results. We develop both lexical and statistical approaches for text query expansion, as well as content-based approaches for visual query expansion. In addition, we study several other recently proposed methods for concept-based query expansion. In total, we compare 7 different approaches for expanding queries with visual semantic concepts. They are evaluated using a large video corpus and 39 concept detectors from the TRECVid-2006 video retrieval benchmark. We observe consistent improvement over the baselines for all 7 approaches, leading to an overall performance gain of 77% relative to a text retrieval baseline, and a 31% improvement relative to a state-of-the-art multimodal retrieval baseline.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Haixue</author><author>Gu, Junzhong</author><author>Lv, Zhao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving the effectiveness of local context analysis based on semantic similarity</title><secondary-title>2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology, ICCIT 2007</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology, ICCIT 2007</full-title></periodical><pages>1474-1480</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0769530389</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICCIT.2007.4420462</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Local context analysis is a main way to enhance the effectiveness of query expansion in the information retrieval field.

In this paper, we introduce a complementary method. The new local context analysis technique is improved by incorporating semantic similarity metric into query expansion model.

One disadvantage of this approach is its dependence to the precision of the ASR system, since transcription errors strongly affect the IR machine. With the aim of reducing the impact of these errors, especially those concerning substitutions, in this paper we propose expanding the queries by means of phonetically similar words, and by this increasing the possibility of matching incorrectly transcribed words from the documents. Results on two very different spoken-document collections show the relevance of the proposed method, which outperformed the MAP from traditional expansion techniques by up to 3.68%. ¬© 2011 Sociedad Espa√±ola Para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rothacker, Dietrich</author><author>Stelter, Helmut</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Beitr??ge zur Resistenzz??chtung gegen den Kartoffelnematoden (Hererodera rostochiensis Wollenweber) - IV.

To overcome the limitations of under-specified queries, we utilize tags to enhance information retrieval capabilities by expanding users' original queries with context-relevant information. We compute a set of significant tag neighbor candidates based on the neighbor frequency and weight, and utilize the most frequent and weighted neighbors to expand an entry query that has terms matching tags. The proposed approach is evaluated using MedWorm medical article collection and standard evaluation methods from the text retrieval conference (TREC).

Retrieval time for inverted lists can be greatly reduced by the use of compression, but this adds to the CPU time required. Here we show that the CPU component of query response time for conjunctive Boolean queries and for informal ranked queries can be similarly reduced, at little cost in terms of storage, by the inclusion of an internal index in each compressed inverted list. This method has been applied in a retrieval system for a collection of nearly two million short documents. Our experimental results show that the self-indexing strategy adds less than 20% to the size of the compressed inverted file, which itself occupies less than 10% of the indexed text, yet can reduce processing time for Boolean queries of 5‚Äì10 terms to under one fifth of the previous cost. Similarly, ranked queries of 40‚Äì50 terms can be evaluated in as little as 25% of the previous time, with little or no loss of retrieval effectiveness.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balog, Krisztian</author><author>Rijke, Maarten de</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining candidate and document models for expert search</title><secondary-title>Seventeenth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2008)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Seventeenth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2008)</full-title></periodical><pages>1-4</pages><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07418825.2010.511245</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ilps.science.uva.nl/%0Ahttp://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;q=intitle:Combining+Candidate+and+Document+Models+for+Expert+Search#1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We describe our participation in the TREC 2008 Enterprise track and detail our lan- guage modeling-based approaches.

Essie's performance was evaluated using data and standard evaluation methods from the 2003 and 2006 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Genomics track. Essie was the best-performing search engine in the 2003 TREC Genomics track and achieved results comparable to those of the highest-ranking systems on the 2006 TREC Genomics track task.

To facilitate using these JavaScript frameworks to implement a feature (e.g., functionality), a large number of programmers often search for code snippets that implement the same or similar feature. However, existing code search approaches tend to be ineffective, without taking into account the fact that JavaScript code snippets often implement a feature based on various relationships (e.g., sequencing, condition, and callback relationships) among the invoked framework API methods. To address this issue, we present a novel RelationshipAware Code Search (RACS) approach for finding code snippets that use JavaScript frameworks to implement a specific feature. In advance, RACS collects a large number of code snippets that use some JavaScript frameworks, mines API usage patterns from the collected code snippets, and represents the mined patterns with method call relationship (MCR) graphs, which capture framework API methods‚Äô signatures and their relationships. Given a natural language (NL) search query issued by a programmer, RACS conducts NL processing to automatically extract an action relationship (AR) graph, which consists of actions and their relationships inferred from the query. In this way, RACS reduces code search to the problem of graph search: finding similar MCR graphs for a given AR graph. We conduct evaluations against representative real-world jQuery questions posted on Stack Overflow, based on 308,294 code snippets collected from over 81,540 files on the Internet. The evaluation results show the effectiveness of RACS: the top 1 snippet produced by RACS matches the target code snippet for 46% questions, compared to only 4% achieved by a relationship-oblivious approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsang, D.</author><author>Yew, D.

The success of TR-based solutions highly depends on the query submitted, which is either formulated by the developer or automatically extracted from software artifacts. Aim:We aim at predicting the quality of queries submitted to TR-based approaches in SE. This can lead to benefits for developers and for the quality of software systems alike. For example, knowing when a query is poorly formulated can save developers the time and frustration of analyzing irrelevant search results. Instead, they could focus on reformulating the query. Also, knowing if an artifact used as a query leads to irrelevant search results may uncover underlying problems in the query artifact itself. Method: We introduce an automatic query quality prediction approach for software artifact retrieval by adapting NL-inspired solutions to their use on software data. We present two applications and evaluations of the approach in the context of concept location and traceability link recovery, where TR has been applied most often in SE. For concept location,we use the approach to determine if the list of retrieved code elements is likely to contain code relevant to a particular change request or not, in which case, the queries are good candidates for reformulation. For traceability link recovery, the queries represent software artifacts. In this case,we use the query quality prediction approach to identify artifacts that are hard to trace to other artifacts and may therefore have a low intrinsic quality for TR-based traceability link recovery. Results: For concept location, the evaluation shows that our approach is able to correctly predict the quality of queries in 82% of the cases, on average, using very little training data. In the case of traceability recovery, the proposed approach is able to detect hard to trace artifacts in 74% of the cases, on average. Conclusions: The results of our evaluation on applications for concept location and traceability link recovery indicate that our approach can be used to predict the results of a TR-based approach by assessing the quality of the text query. This can lead to saved effort and time, as well as the identification of software artifacts that may be difficult to trace using TR.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>ALMasri, Mohannad</author><author>Berrut, Catherine</author><author>Chevallet, Jean Pierre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of deep learning based query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback and mutual information</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</full-title></periodical><pages>709-715</pages><volume>9626</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>9783319306704</isbn><accession-num>200504</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_57</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Automatic query expansion techniques are widely applied for improving text retrieval performance, using a variety of approaches that exploit several data sources for finding expansion terms. Selecting expansion terms is challenging and requires a framework capable of extracting term relationships. Recently, several Natural Language Processing methods, based on Deep Learning, are proposed for learning high quality vector representations of terms from a large amount of unstructured text with billions of words. These high quality vector representations capture a large number of term relationships. In this paper, we experimentally compare several expansion methods with expansion using these term vector representations. We use language models for information retrieval to evaluate expansion methods. Experiments conducted on four CLEF collections show a statistically significant improvement over the language models and other expansion models.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brand√£o, Wladmir C.</author><author>Santos, Rodrygo L.T.</author><author>Ziviani, Nivio</author><author>De Moura, Edleno S.</author><author>Da Silva, Altigran S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Learning to expand queries using entities</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1870-1883</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>2330-1635</isbn><accession-num>502955140</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/asi.23084</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>A substantial fraction of web search queries contain references to entities, such as persons, organizations, and locations.

Unfortunately, to date, evaluations of code search techniques have largely been in lab settings, while scaling and transitioning to effective practical use demands more empirical feedback from the field. This paper addresses that need by studying metrics based on automatically-gathered anonymous field data from code searches to infer user satisfaction. We describe techniques for addressing important concerns, such as how privacy is retained and how the overhead on the interactive system is minimized. We perform controlled user and field studies which identify metrics that correlate with user satisfaction, enabling the future evaluation of search tools through anonymous usage data. In comparing our metrics to similar metrics used in Internet search we observe differences in the relationship of some of the metrics to user satisfaction. As we further explore the data, we also present a predictive multi-metric model that achieves accuracy of over 70% in determining query satisfaction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrientos, Ricardo J.</author><author>G√≥mez, Jos√© I.</author><author>Tenllado, Christian</author><author>Matias, Manuel Prieto</author><author>Marin, Mauricio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Range query processing in a multi-GPU environment</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 2012 10th IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, ISPA 2012</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 2012 10th IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, ISPA 2012</full-title></periodical><pages>419-426</pages><keywords><keyword>GPU</keyword><keyword>Similarity search</keyword><keyword>metric databases</keyword><keyword>metric spaces</keyword><keyword>multi-GPU</keyword><keyword>range query</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>9780769547015</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ISPA.2012.61</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Similarity search has been widely studied in the last years, as it can be applied to several fields such as searching by content in multimedia objects, text retrieval or computational biology. These applications usually work on very large databases that are often indexed off-line to enable the acceleration of on-line searches. However, to maintain an acceptable throughput, it is essential to exploit the intrinsic parallelism of the algorithms used for the on-line query solving process, even with indexed databases. Therefore, many strategies have been proposed in the literature to parallelize these algorithms, both on shared and distributed memory multiprocessor systems. Lately, GPUs have also been used to implement brute-force approaches instead of using indexing structures, due to the difficulties introduced by the index in the efficient exploitation of the GPU resources. In this work we propose a Multi-GPU metric-space technique that efficiently exploits index data structures for similarity search in large databases, and show how it outperforms previous OpenMP and GPU brute-force strategies.

Handling snippets allows us to consume code from various sources such as parts of open source projects, educational resources (e.g. tutorials), and expert code sites. To handle code snippets, our approach (i) extracts a possibly partial temporal speciÔ¨Åcation from each snippet using a relatively precise static analysis tracking a generalized notion of typestate, and (ii) consolidates the partial temporal speciÔ¨Åcations, combining consistent partial information to yield consolidated temporal speciÔ¨Å- cations, each of which captures a full(er) usage scenario. To answer a search query, we deÔ¨Åne a notion of relaxed inclusion matching a query against temporal speciÔ¨Åcations and their corresponding code snippets.

PRIME was able to analyze and consolidate thousands of snippets per tested API, and our results indicate that the combination of a relatively precise analysis and consolidation allowed PRIME to answer challenging queries effectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Renxu</author><author>Jiang, Jing</author><author>Tan, Yee Fan</author><author>Cui, Hang</author><author>Chua, Tat-Seng</author><author>Kan, Min-Yen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Syntactic and Semantic Relation Analysis in Question Answering</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 14th Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2005)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 14th Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2005)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cuihang.com/publications/nus.qa.2005.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>1 Introduction Our participation at TREC this year focuses on integrating dependency and semantic relation analysis of external resources into our existing QA system. In TREC-13, we have proposed the use of dependency relation matching to perform answer extraction for factoid and list questions. The results showed that the technique is effective in answer extraction within the corpus. However, we have also identified some problems and limitations with this technique. First, dependency relation matching does not perform well on short questions, which have only very few key terms. Therefore we need to integrate query expansion and make use of external resources to provide additional contextual information to these short questions. Second, the technique cannot be directly applied to extract answer nuggets from external web pages. As web pages contain much more noise as compared to the corpus, statistical based dependency relation matching tends to make a lot of errors based on our previously trained model on the corpus. Moreover, we do not have sufficient training data to retrain a model on the web. Therefore we propose to use semantic relation analysis to supplement dependency relation analysis to extract answer nuggets for factoid and list questions on the web. Finally, we adopt a soft pattern matching model (Cui et al., 2005) for definition sentence retrieval in the definitional QA task. We focus on the following three features in this year's TREC: (1) We incorporate dependency relation analysis into query expansion based on external web resources, and we perform query expansion for both document and passage retrieval to provide more contextual information for short questions. (2) We propose the use of semantic relation analysis to extract answer nuggets for factoid and list questions from external web resources. These external answer nuggets can either be directly projected back to the corpus (for list questions) or be used as additional supporting evidence for corpus-based answer extraction (for factoid questions).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mahala, Avijit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Processes and Status of Land Degradation in a Plateau Fringe Region of Tropical Environment</title><secondary-title>Environmental Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>663-682</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Anthropogenic activities</keyword><keyword>Eastern Chotanagpur plateau</keyword><keyword>Irrigation intensity</keyword><keyword>Land degradation</keyword><keyword>Land degradation vulnerability</keyword><keyword>Soil degradation</keyword><keyword>Weighted multiplication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>17329729</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s40710-017-0255-6</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This article describes the algorithms implemented in the Essie search engine that is currently serving several Web sites at the National Library of Medicine. Essie is a phrase-based search engine with term and concept query expansion and probabilistic relevancy ranking. Essie's design is motivated by an observation that query terms are often conceptually related to terms in a document, without actually occurring in the document text. Essie's performance was evaluated using data and standard evaluation methods from the 2003 and 2006 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Genomics track. Essie was the best-performing search engine in the 2003 TREC Genomics track and achieved results comparable to those of the highest-ranking systems on the 2006 TREC Genomics track task. Essie shows that a judicious combination of exploiting document structure, phrase searching, and concept based query expansion is a useful approach for information retrieval in the biomedical domain.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chum, Ondrej</author><author>Philbin, James</author><author>Sivic, Josef</author><author>Isard, Michael</author><author>Zisserman, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Total recall: Automatic query expansion with a generative feature model for object retrieval</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>978-1-4244-1630-1</isbn><accession-num>15337965</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408891</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Given a query image of an object, our objective is to retrieve all instances of that object in a large (1M+) image database. We adopt the bag-of-visual-words architecture which has proven successful in achieving high precision at low recall. Unfortunately, feature detection and quantization are noisy processes and this can result in variation in the particular visual words that appear in different images of the same object, leading to missed results. In the text retrieval literature a standard method for improving performance is query expansion. A number of the highly ranked documents from the original query are reissued as a new query. In this way, additional relevant terms can be added to the query. This is a form of blind rele- vance feedback and it can fail if 'outlier' (false positive) documents are included in the reissued query. In this paper we bring query expansion into the visual domain via two novel contributions. Firstly, strong spatial constraints between the query image and each result allow us to accurately verify each return, suppressing the false positives which typically ruin text-based query expansion. Secondly, the verified images can be used to learn a latent feature model to enable the controlled construction of expanded queries. We illustrate these ideas on the 5000 annotated image Oxford building database together with more than 1M Flickr images. We show that the precision is substantially boosted, achieving total recall in many cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahman, Mohammad Masudur</author><author>Roy, Chanchal K.</author><author>Lo, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RACK: Code search in the IDE using crowdsourced knowledge</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion, ICSE-C 2017</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion, ICSE-C 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>51-54</pages><keywords><keyword>API association</keyword><keyword>Code search</keyword><keyword>Crowdsourced knowledge</keyword><keyword>Query reformulation</keyword><keyword>Stack Overflow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>9781538615898</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.11</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>CITATIONS 0 READS 32 3 , including : Some : RevHelper : Model Plant (P2IRC) View Mohammad University 20 SEE Chanchal .

As of today, the only way to locate infor- mation archived exclusively in libraries is through their catalogs. Library patrons,however,oftenfindit difficult to formulate a proper query, which requires using specific keywords assigned to different fields of desired library catalog records, to obtain relevant results.These improp- erly formulated queries often yield irrelevant results or no results at all. This negative experience in dealing with existing library systems turns library patrons away from directly querying library catalogs; instead, they rely on Web search engines to perform their searches first, and upon obtaining the initial information (e.g., titles, subject headings, or authors) on the desired library materials, they query library catalogs. This searching strategy is an evidence of failure of today‚Äôs library sys- tems. In solving this problem, we propose an enhanced library system, which allows partial, similarity matching of (a) tags defined by ordinary users at a folksonomy site that describe the content of books and (b) unrestricted keywords specified by an ordinary library patron in a query to search for relevant library catalog records. The proposed library system allows patrons posting a query Q using commonly used words and ranks the retrieved results according to their degrees of resemblance withQ while maintaining the query processing time comparable with that achieved by current library search engines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lemos, Otavio A.L.</author><author>de Paula, Adriano C.</author><author>Konishi, Gustavo</author><author>Bajracharya, Sushil</author><author>Ossher, Joel</author><author>Lopes, Cristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thesaurus-based tag clouds for test-driven code search</title><secondary-title>Journal of Universal Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Universal Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>772-796</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Code search</keyword><keyword>Software reuse</keyword><keyword>Tag clouds</keyword><keyword>Test-driven code search</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><urls/><abstract>Test-driven code search (TDCS) is an approach to code search and reuse that uses test cases as inputs to form the search query. Together with the test cases that provide more semantics to the search task, keywords taken from class and method names are still required. Therefore, the effectiveness of the approach also relies on how good these keywords are, i.e., how frequently they are chosen by developers to name the desired functions. To help users choose adequate words in their query test cases, visual aids can be used. In this paper we propose thesaurus-based tag clouds to show developers terms that are more frequently used in the code repository to improve their search. Terms are generated by looking up words similar to the initial keywords on a thesaurus. Tag clouds are then formed based on the frequency in which these terms appear in the code base. Our approach was implemented with an English thesaurus as an extension to CodeGenie, a Java- and Eclipse-based TDCS tool. Our evaluation shows evidence that the approach can help improve the number of returned results, recall (by~ 28%, on average), and precision (by~ 14%, on average). We also noticed the visual aid can be especially useful for non-native speakers of the language in which the code repository is written. These users are frequently unaware of the most common terms used to name specific functionality in the code, in the given language. ¬© J.UCS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Renals, Steve</author><author>Abberley, Dave</author><author>Kirby, David</author><author>Robinson, Tony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indexing and retrieval of broadcast news</title><secondary-title>Speech Communication</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Speech Communication</full-title></periodical><pages>5-20</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0167-6393(00)00020-0</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This paper describes a spoken document retrieval (SDR) system for British and North American Broadcast News.

Existing static code search techniques using natural language queries provide little support to help developers determine whether search results are relevant, and few recommend alternative words to help developers reformulate poor queries. In this paper, we present a novel approach that automatically extracts natural language phrases from source code identifiers and categorizes the phrases and search results in a hierarchy. Our contextual search approach allows developers to explore the word usage in a piece of software, helping them to quickly identify relevant program elements for investigation or to quickly recognize alternative words for query reformulation. An empirical evaluation of 22 developers reveals that our contextual search approach significantly outperforms the most closely related technique in terms of effort and effectiveness.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahman, M.

In this framework, images are represented by vectors of weighted concepts similar to the keyword-based representation used in text retrieval. To generate the concept vocabularies, a statistical model is built by utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classification techniques. The images are represented as &quot;bag of concepts&quot; that comprise perceptually and/or semantically distinguishable color and texture patches from local image regions in a multi-dimensional feature space. To explore the correlation between the concepts and overcome the assumption of feature independence in this model, we propose query expansion techniques in the image domain from a new perspective based on both local and global analysis. For the local analysis, the correlations between the concepts based on the co-occurrence pattern, and the metrical constraints based on the neighborhood proximity between the concepts in encoded images, are analyzed by considering local feedback information. We also analyze the concept similarities in the collection as a whole in the form of a similarity thesaurus and propose an efficient query expansion based on the global analysis. The experimental results on a photographic collection of natural scenes and a biomedical database of different imaging modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of precision and recall. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, there have been efforts to apply feedback to semi-structured XML document collections as well. In this paper, we note that feedback can also be an effective tool for exploring (through result ranking and query refinement) large semi-structured data collections. In particular, in large scale data sharing and curation environments, where the user may not know the structure of the data, queries may initially be overly vague. Given a path query and a set of results identified by the system to this query over the data, we consider two types of feedback: Soft feedback captures the user's preference for some features over the others. Hard feedback, on the other hand, expresses users' assertions regarding whether certain features should be further enforced or, in contrast, are to be avoided. Both soft and hard feedback can be &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;. For soft feedback, we develop a probabilistic feature significance measure and describe how to use this for ranking results in the presence of dependencies between the path features. To deal with the hard feedback efficiently (i.e., fast enough for interactive exploration), we present finite automata based query refinement solutions. In particular, we present a novel LazyDFA+ algorithm for managing hard feedback. We also describe optimizations that leverage the inherently iterative nature of the feedback process. We bring together these techniques in AXP, a system for adaptive and exploratory path retrieval. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pampalk, Elias</author><author>Flexer, Arthur</author><author>Widmer, Gerhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hierarchical organization and description of music collections at the artist level</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</full-title></periodical><pages>37-48</pages><volume>3652 LNCS</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>3540287671</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/11551362_4</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>As digital music collections grow, so does the need to organizing them automatically.

Unfortunately, there are many application scenarios where such an evaluation is not possible or does not adequately meet users needs. A further problematic application area is text retrieval where in general finding a complete match is impossible. Thus, there is a need for incorporating impreciseness and proximity into a logic-based query language: Objects fulfill such a similarity condition to a certain degree which is expressed by a result value out of the interval [0, 1]. In this work we will sketch a quantum logic-based approach, which provides the combination of classical Boolean predicates and similarity conditions into one integrating formalism.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kaloni, T.

This paper discusses three facets of this problem and then describes an attempt to address them so as to improve the retrieval performance.

A series of experimental studies are described as performed in the context of the Sixth Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Moderate benefits were achieved through query processing, though additional work needs to be done to fully incorporate phrases, eliminate noise words, and take advantage of co-occurrence analysis developed in this study.

Knowing word relatedness allows a system given a user's query terms to retrieve relevant documents not containing those exact terms. Two words can be said to be related if they appear in the same contexts Document co-occurrence gives a measure of word relatedness that has proved to be too rough to be useful. The relatively recent apparition of on-line dictionaries and robust and rapid parsers permits the extraction of finer word contexts from large corpora. In this paper, we will describe such an extraction technique that uses only coarse syntactic analysis and no domain knowledge. This technique produces lists of words related to any word appearing in a corpus. When the closest related terms were used in query expansion of a standard information retrieval testbed, the results were much better than that given by document, co-occurrence techniques, and slightly better than using unexpanded queries, supporting the contention that semantically similar words were indeed extracted by this technique.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gurulingappa, Harsha</author><author>Bernd, M</author><author>Hofmann-apitius, Martin</author><author>Fluck, Juliane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Information Retrieval Framework for Technology Survey in Biomedical and Chemistry Literature</title><secondary-title>The Twentieth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2011) Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Twentieth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2011) Proceedings</full-title></periodical><pages>1-4</pages><issue>Xml</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>9781403979308</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/9781403979308_7</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec20/t20.proceedings.html</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Technology survey task deals with the retrieval of information that can best answer a scientific question.

Query structure means the use of operators to express the relations between search keys. Six different structures were tested, representing strong structures (e.g., queries with facets or concepts identified) and weak structures (no concepts identified, a query is 'a bag of search keys' ). QE was based on concepts, which were first selected from a searching thesaurus, and then expanded by semantic relationships given in the thesaurus. The expansion levels were (a) no expansion, (b) a synonym expansion, (c) a narrower concept expansion, (d) an associative concept expansion, and (e) a cumulative expansion of all other expansions. With weak structures and Boolean structured queries, QE was not very effective. The best performance was achieved with a combination of a facet structure, where search keys within a facet were treated as instances of one search key (the SYN operator), and the largest expansion. {\copyright} 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vries, Arjen P.

The main characteristic of the\n&quot;database approach&quot; is that it increases the value of data by its\nemphasis on data independence. DBMSs, and in particular those based\non the relational data model, have been very successful at the management\nof administrative data in the business domain.\n\n\nThis thesis has investigated data management in multimedia digital\nlibraries, and its implications on the design of database management\nsystems. The main problem of multimedia data management is providing\naccess to the stored objects. The content structure of administrative\ndata is easily represented in alphanumeric values. Thus, database\ntechnology has primarily focused on handling the objects' logical\nstructure. In the case of multimedia data, representation of content\nis far from trivial though, and not supported by current database\nmanagement systems.\n\n\nThe information retrieval (IR) community has since long studied the\nretrieval of text documents by their content. Also, research in topics\nlike computer vision and image analysis has led to content-based\nretrieval techniques for querying image and audio collections. Retrieval\nsystems based on these ideas are typically standalone systems that\nhave been developed for very specific applications. There is not\nmuch consensus on the integration of these techniques in general-purpose\nDBMSs. State-of-the-art solutions simply make new functions available\nin the query language. These functions interface to otherwise still\nstandalone software systems. This leaves to the user the burdens\nof both query formulation and the combination of results for each\nsingle representation into a final judgement. Also, this leads to\ninefficient query processing for queries involving several content\nrepresentations.\n\n\nLike any DBMS, a MM-DBMS is a general-purpose software system that\nsupports various applications; but, the support is targeted to applications\nin the specific domain of digital libraries. Four new requirements\nhave been identified for this domain: (1) multimedia objects can\nbe active objects, (2) querying is an interaction process, (3) query\nprocessing uses multiple representations, and (4) query formulation\nprovides content independence. The Mirror Architecture and its implementation\nin the Mirror DBMS therefore provide basic functionality for the\nmanagement of both the content structure and the logical structure\nof multimedia objects.\n\n\nIn the Mirror DBMS, content management and databases are completely\nintegrated. Recognizing the strong relationship with IR query processing,\nthe inference network retrieval model has been adapted for multimedia\nretrieval. The logical algebra of the DBMS has been extended with\noperators for probabilistic inference in this retrieval model. This\napproach to integration enables the study of new query optimization\ntechniques, and simplifies the introduction of parallellism and distribution\nin IR query evaluation.\n\n\nOther characteristics of multimedia digital libraries demand the support\nfor distribution of both data and operations, and extensibility of\ndata types and operations.

We evaluate the utility of four auxiliary collections for the Text REtrieval Conference task of IR-based cohort retrieval, considering the effects of collection size, the inherent difficulty of a query, and the interaction between the collections. Each collection was applied to aid in cohort retrieval from the Pittsburgh NLP Repository by using a mixture of relevance models. Measured by mean average precision, performance using any auxiliary resource (MAP. = 0.386 and above) is shown to improve over the baseline query likelihood model (MAP. = 0.373). Considering subsets of the Mayo Clinic collection, we found that after including 2.5 billion term instances, retrieval is not improved by adding more instances. However, adding the Mayo Clinic collection did improve performance significantly over any existing setup, with a system using all four auxiliary collections obtaining the best results (MAP. = 0.4223). Because optimal results in the mixture of relevance models would require selective sampling of the collections, the common sense approach of &quot;use all available data&quot; is inappropriate. However, we found that it was still beneficial to add the Mayo corpus to any mixture of relevance models. On the task of IR-based cohort identification, query expansion with the Mayo Clinic corpus resulted in consistent and significant improvements. As such, any IR query expansion with access to a large clinical corpus could benefit from the additional resource. Additionally, we have shown that more data is not necessarily better, implying that there is value in collection curation. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Babashzadeh, Atanaz</author><author>Daoud, Mariam</author><author>Huang, Jimmy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using semantic-based association rule mining for improving clinical text retrieval</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</full-title></periodical><pages>186-197</pages><volume>7798 LNCS</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>9783642378980</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-642-37899-7_16</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Association rule (AR) mining has been widely used on the electronic medical records (EMR) for discovering hidden knowledge and medical patterns and also for improving the information retrieval performance via query expansion. A major obstacle in association rule mining is that often a huge number of rules are generated even with very reasonable support and confidence. The main challenge of using AR in information retrieval (IR) is to select the rules that are related to the query, since many of them are trivial, redundant or semantically wrong. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling medical query contexts based on mining semantic-based AR for improving clinical text retrieval. We semantically index the EMR with concepts of UMLS ontology. First, the concepts in the query context are derived from the rules that cover the query and then weighted according to their semantic relatedness to the query concepts. The query context is then exploited to re-rank patients records for improving clinical retrieval performance. We evaluate our approach on the medical TREC dataset. Results show that our proposed approach allows performing better retrieval performance than the probabilistic BM25 model.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Hanhua</author><author>Jin, Hai</author><author>Luo, Xucheng</author><author>Liu, Yunhao</author><author>Gu, Tao</author><author>Chen, Kaiji</author><author>Ni, Lionel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BloomCast: Efficient and effective full-text retrieval in unstructured P2P networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>232-241</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Bloom Filter</keyword><keyword>Peer-to-peer systems</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TPDS.2011.168</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Efficient and effective full-text retrieval in unstructured peer-to-peer networks remains a challenge in the research community. First, it is difficult, if not impossible, for unstructured P2P systems to effectively locate items with guaranteed recall. Second, existing schemes to improve search success rate often rely on replicating a large number of item replicas across the wide area network, incurring a large amount of communication and storage costs. In this paper, we propose BloomCast, an efficient and effective full-text retrieval scheme, in unstructured P2P networks. By leveraging a hybrid P2P protocol, BloomCast replicates the items uniformly at random across the P2P networks, achieving a guaranteed recall at a communication cost of O√∞ ffiffiffiffiffiNp √û, whereN is the size of the network. Furthermore, by casting Bloom Filters instead of the raw documents across the network, BloomCast significantly reduces the communication and storage costs for replication. We demonstrate the power of BloomCast design through both mathematical proof and comprehensive simulations based on the query logs from a major commercial search engine and NIST TREC WT10G data collection. Results show that BloomCast achieves an average query recall of 91 percent, which outperforms the existing WP algorithm by 18 percent, while BloomCast greatly reduces the search latency for query processing by 57 percent.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitsui, Matthew</author><author>Chirag, Shah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Query Generation as Result Aggregation for Knowledge Representation</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4365-4374</pages><keywords><keyword>can we instead determine</keyword><keyword>from relevant</keyword><keyword>instead</keyword><keyword>pre-existing queries are used</keyword><keyword>queries to end users</keyword><keyword>relevant</keyword><keyword>snippets of information</keyword><keyword>that recommends constructed queries</keyword><keyword>to a holistic approach</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>9780998133102</isbn><urls/><abstract>Knowledge representations have greatly enhanced the fundamental human problem of information search, profoundly changing representations of queries and database information for various retrieval tasks. Despite new technologies, little thought has been given in the field of query recommendation ‚Äì recommending keyword queries to end users ‚Äì to a holistic approach that recommends constructed queries from relevant snippets of information; pre-existing queries are used instead. Can we instead determine relevant information a user should see and aggregate it into a query? We construct a general framework leveraging various retrieval architectures to aggregate relevant information into a natural language query for recommendation. We test this framework in text retrieval, aggregating text snippets and comparing output queries to user generated queries. We show that an algorithm can generate queries more closely resembling the original and give effective retrieval results. Our simple approach shows promise for also leveraging knowledge structures to generate effective query recommendations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jingang</author><author>Song, Dandan</author><author>Lin, CY</author><author>Liao, Lejian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BIT and MSRA at TREC KBA CCR Track 2013</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 22nd Text Retrieval Conference</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 22nd Text Retrieval Conference</full-title></periodical><issue>i</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://trec.nist.gov/trec/pubs/trec22/papers/BIT-MSRA-kba.pdf%0Ahttp://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec22/papers/BIT-MSRA-kba.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>La piste d'acc√©l√©ration de bases de connaissance (KBA -- Knowledge Base Acceleration) de TREC a donc pour objectif de trouver des m√©thodes pour g√©rer dynamiquement les flux d'information et la mise √† jour des bases de connaissance.

All rights reserved.Recent years have seen significant efforts in the area of Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) for text retrieval. This work initially focused on formally published content, but more recently research has begun to concentrate on CLIR for informal social media content. However, despite the current expansion in online multimedia archives, there has been little work on CLIR for this content. While there has been some limited work on Cross-Language Video Retrieval (CLVR) for professional videos, such as documentaries or TV news broadcasts, there has to date, been no significant investigation of CLVR for the rapidly growing archives of informal user generated (UGC) content. Key differences between such UGC and professionally produced content are the nature and structure of the textual UGC metadata associated with it, as well as the form and quality of the content itself. In this setting, retrieval effectiveness may not only suffer from translation errors common to all CLIR tasks, but also recognition errors associated with the automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems used to transcribe the spoken content of the video and with the informality and inconsistency of the associated user-created metadata for each video. This work proposes and evaluates techniques to improve CLIR effectiveness of such noisy UGC content. Our experimental investigation shows that different sources of evidence, e.g. the content from different fields of the structured metadata, significantly affect CLIR effectiveness. Results from our experiments also show that each metadata field has a varying robustness to query expansion (QE) and hence can have a negative impact on the CLIR effectiveness. Our work proposes a novel adaptive QE technique that predicts the most reliable source for expansion and shows how this technique can be effective for improving CLIR effectiveness for UGC content.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beaulieu, Micheline</author><author>Robertson, Stephen</author><author>Rasmussen, Edie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating interactive systems in TREC</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Society for Information Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Society for Information Science</full-title></periodical><pages>85-94</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1996</year></dates><isbn>1097-4571</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199601)47:1&lt;85::AID-ASI8&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) experiments were designed to allow large-scale laboratory testing of information retrieval techniques.

Our proposal advocates the use of Instance Based Reasoning during the information retrieval process. When conducting a search, the system retrieves a previous similar search experience and traces back previous human reasoning and behavior and then replicates it in the current situation. Thus, user information retrieval experiences or instances are saved to be reused in future similar cases. The resulting cooperative memory is used for user query expansion. In order to improve the information retrieval experience, we propose to conceptualize and model both the user profile, and the information retrieval process. This leads us to define some similarity functions between user profiles and information retrieval situations. The reuse of past experiences serves to enrich the initial user query by words from documents found in similar cases. Unlike the classical Rocchio method, these documents are those already judged as valid by users with similar profile and in similar search situation. The value this method brings to the user is an increasing relevance of the search outcomes while reducing user interaction with the system. This method has been implemented in the COSYDOR (Cooperative System for Document Retrieval) prototype based on Intermedia (Oracle 8i). Tests and evaluations have been performed on the COSYDOR prototype using the test corpus of TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) and its standard procedures for performance analysis and benchmarking. The results of these analyses show a significant improvement of performance in the first search iterations compared to the Intermedia benchmark.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lemos, Otavio Augusto Lazzarini</author><author>De Paula, Adriano Carvalho</author><author>Konishi, Gustavo</author><author>Ossher, Joel</author><author>Bajracharya, Sushil</author><author>Lopes, Cristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using thesaurus-based tag clouds to improve test-driven code search</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 7th Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures and Reuse, SBCARs 2013 - In Conjunction with CBSoft 2013 - 4th Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - 7th Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures and Reuse, SBCARs 2013 - In Conjunction with CBSoft 2013 - 4th Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>99-108</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>9780769551562</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SBCARS.2013.21</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Test-driven code search (TDCS) is an approach to code search and reuse that uses test cases as inputs to form the search query. Together with the test cases that provide more semantics to the search task, keywords taken from class and method names are still required. Therefore, the effectiveness of the approach also relies on how good these keywords are, i.e., how frequently they are chosen by developers to name the desired functions. To help users choose adequate words in their query test cases, visual aids can be used. In this paper we propose thesaurus-based tag clouds to show developers terms that are more frequently used in the code repository to improve their search. Terms are generated by looking up words similar to the initial keywords on a thesaurus. Tag clouds are then formed based on the frequency in which these terms appear in the code base. Our approach was implemented with an English thesaurus as an extension to CodeGenie, a Java- and Eclipse-based TDCS tool. Our evaluation shows that the approach can help improve the number of returned results. We also noticed the visual aid can be especially useful for non-native speakers of the language in which the code repository is written. These users are frequently unaware of the most common terms used to name specific functionality in the code, in the given language. ¬© 2013 IEEE.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartell, Brian T.</author><author>Cottrell, Garrison W.</author><author>Belew, Richard K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimizing Similarity Using Multi-Query Relevance Feedback</title><secondary-title>JASIS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JASIS</full-title></periodical><pages>742-761</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1442-8903.2002.00114.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/journals/jasis/BartellCB98</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We propose a novel method for automatically adjusting parameters in ranked-output text retrieval systems to improve retrieval performance. A ranked-output text retrieval system implements a ranking function which orders documents, placing documents estimated to be more relevant to the user's query before less relevant ones. The system adjusts its parameters to maximize the match between the system's document ordering and a target ordering. The target ordering is typically given by user feedback on a set of sample queries, but is more generally any document preference relation. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by using it to estimate a similarity measure (scoring the relevance of documents to queries) in a vector space model of information retrieval. Experimental results using several collections indicate that the approach automatically finds a similarity measure which performs equivalently to or better than all classic similarity measures studied. It also performs within 1% of an estimated optimal measure (found by exhaustive sampling of the similarity measures). The method is compared to two alternative methods: A Perceptron learning rule motivated by Wong and Yao's (1990) Query Formulation method, and a Least Squared learning rule, motivated by Fuhr and Buckley's (1991) Probabilistic Learning approach. Though both alternatives have useful characteristics, we demonstrate empirically that neither can be used to estimate the parameters of the optimal similarity measure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qin, Jialun</author><author>Zhou, Yilu</author><author>Chau, Michael</author><author>Chen, Hsinchun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multilingual web retrieval: An experiment in English-Chinese business intelligence</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>671-683</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>15322882</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/asi.20329</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>As increasing numbers of non-English resources have become available on\nthe Web, the interesting and important issue of how Web users can\nretrieve documents in different languages has arisen.

Methods such as query expansion, based on thesaural information or automatic feedback, are used to add further terms, and can yield significant though usually small gains in effectiveness. Another approach to adding terms, which we investigate in this paper, is to use natural language technology to annotate - and thus disambiguate - key terms by the concept they represent. Using biomedical research documents, we quantify the potential benefits of tagging users' targeted concepts in queries and documents in domain-specific information retrieval. Our experiments, based on the TREC Genomics track data, both on passage and full-text retrieval, found no evidence that automatic concept recognition in general is of significant value for this task. Moreover, the issues raised by these results suggest that it is difficult for such disambiguation to be effective. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This enables the preservation, sharing, and significantly the searching of these documents. The text contents of these document images can be transcribed automatically using OCR systems and then stored in an information retrieval system. However, OCR systems make errors in character recognition which have previously been shown to impact on document retrieval behaviour. In particular relevance feedback query-expansion methods, which are often effective for improving electronic text retrieval, are observed to be less reliable for retrieval of scanned document images. Our experimental examination of the effects of character recognition errors on an ad hoc OCR retrieval task demonstrates that, while baseline information retrieval can remain relatively unaffected by transcription errors, relevance feedback via query expansion becomes highly unstable. This paper examines the reason for this behaviour, and introduces novel modifications to standard relevance feedback methods. These methods are shown experimentally to improve the effectiveness of relevance feedback for errorful OCR transcriptions. The new methods combine similar recognised character strings based on term collection frequency and a string edit-distance measure. The techniques are domain independent and make no use of external resources such as dictionaries or training data. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Our sys-tems ranked 3th out of 21 teams.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allan, James</author><author>Ballesteros, L</author><author>Callan, J P</author><author>Croft, W B</author><author>Lu, Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recent Experiments with INQUERY</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Fourth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-4)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the Fourth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-4)</full-title></periodical><pages>49-72</pages><keywords/><dates><year>1996</year></dates><urls/><abstract>Past TREC experiment sby the University of Masschusetts have focused primarily on ad-hoc query creation. Substantial effort was directed towards automatically translating TREC topics into queries, using a set of simple heuristics and query expansion. Less emphasis was placed on the routing task, although results were generally good. The spanish experiments in TREC-3 concentrated on simple indexing, sophisticated stemming, and simple methods of creating queries. The TREC-4 experiments were a departure from the past. The ad-hoc experiments involved &quot;fine tuning&quot; existing approaches, and modifications to the INQUERY term weighting algorithm. However, much of the research focus in TREC-4 was on the routing, Spanish, and collection merging document filtering, distributed IR, and multilingual retreival. The University of Massachusetts' experiments were conducted with version 3.0 of the INQUERY information retrieval system. INQUERY is based on Bayesian inference network retrieval model. It is described elsewhere, so this paper focuses on relevant differences to the previously published algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Basili, R.</author><author>Moschitti, a.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A robust model for intelligent text classification</title><secondary-title>Proceedings 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence.

Text categorization is an interesting area for evaluating and quantifying the impact of linguistic information. Works in text retrieval through Internet suggest that embedding linguistic information at a suitable level within traditional quantitative approaches (e.g. sense distinctions for query expansion as in [14]) is the crucial issue able to bring the experimental stage to operational results.This kind of representational problem is also studied in this paper where traditional methods for statistical text categorization are augmented via a systematic use of linguistic information. Again, as in [14], the addition of NLP capabilities also suggested a different application of existing methods in revised forms. This paper presents an extension of the Rocchio formula [11] as a feature weighting and selection model used as a basis for multilingual Information Extraction. It allows an effective exploitation of the available linguistic information that better emphasizes this latter with significant both data compression and accuracy. The results is an original statistical classifier fed with linguistic (i.e. more complex) features and characterized by the novel feature selection and weighting model. It outperforms existing systems by keeping most of their interesting properties (i.e. easy implementation, low complexity and high scalability). Extensive tests of the model suggest its application as a viable and robust tool for large scale text classification and filtering, as well as a basic module for more complex scenarios.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ye, Zheng</author><author>Huang, Xiangji</author><author>Lin, Hongfei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards a better performance for medical image retrieval using an integrated approach</title><secondary-title>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</full-title></periodical><volume>1175</volume><keywords><keyword>Cbir</keyword><keyword>Mesh</keyword><keyword>Ontologies</keyword><keyword>Pseudo relevance feedback</keyword><keyword>Visual and textual retrieval</keyword><keyword>Weighting model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>16130073 (ISSN)</isbn><urls/><abstract>In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for medical image retrieval.

Second, we will evaluate statistical-based feedback models and ontology-based feedback models. Third, we will investigate how content-based image retrieval can be integrated with these two basic technologies of traditional text retrieval. The experimental results have shown that 1) traditional weighting models can work well in context-based medical image retrieval task especially when the parameters are tuned properly; 2) statistical-based feedback models can improve the retrieval performance when a small number of documents are used; however, the medical image retrieval can not benefit from ontology-based query expansion; 3) the retrieval performance can be slightly boosted by integrating content features.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Demetriou, George</author><author>Skadina, Inguna</author><author>Keskustalo, Heikki</author><author>Karlgren, Jussi</author><author>Deksne, Daiga</author><author>Petrelli, Daniela</author><author>Hansen, Preben</author><author>Gaizauskas, Robert</author><author>Sanderson, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cross-lingual document retrieval categorisation and navigation based on distributed services</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the First Baltic Conference Human Language Technologies the Baltic Perspective</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the First Baltic Conference Human Language Technologies the Baltic Perspective</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4533/</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The widespread use of the Internet across countries has increased the need for access to document collections that are often written in languages different from a users native language.

Clarity is a fully-fledged retrieval system that supports the user during the whole process of query formulation, text retrieval and document browsing. We address four of the major aspects of Clarity: (i) the user-driven methodology that formed the basis for the iterative design cycle and framework in the project, (ii) the system architecture that was developed to support the interaction and coordination of Claritys distributed services, (iii) the data resources and methods for query translation, and (iv) the support for Baltic languages.

We mainly investigated three research problems: 1. Evidence Aggregation: In last year's track there were two different methods in general for obtaining a visit ranking out of reports (smaller document units), i.e., (A) using reports as indexing and retrieval units and then converting a report ranking into a visit ranking, and (B) using visits as indexing and retrieval units by concatenating reports at the very first stage and then obtain a visit ranking directly. Method A avoids the potential problem of varying visit document length, while Method B naturally aggregates evidence scatter over multiple reports and easily obtains a visit ranking. It is unclear which method is better based on all reported results. Thus, we compared the two approaches, tried various score aggregation methods for (A), and combined both approaches in a way that further improved the system performance. 2. Expansion Sources: We tested a variety of external collections (ranging from general web datasets to domain-specific thesauri, and from Megabyte datasets to Terabyte datasets) for query expansion, compared their effectiveness, and obtained useful insights into the data. 3. Retrieval Models: We tested several statistical IR models (proven to be effective on news and web collections) on this medical collection, and explored ways to combine these models to address different aspects of task. For instance, we used MRF model to model term proximity since most medical concepts are phrases. We also used a mixture of relevance models to obtain various relevant expansion terms covered by different expansion collections respectively, which is expect to significantly alleviate the vocabulary mismatch between medical terminologies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larson, Ray R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Back to basics - Again - for domain-specific retrieval</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</full-title></periodical><pages>203-206</pages><volume>5706 LNCS</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>3642044468</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-642-04447-2_25</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In this paper we will describe Berkeley's approach to the Domain Specific (DS) track for CLEF 2008. Last year we used Entry Vocabulary Indexes and Thesaurus expansion approaches for DS, but found in later testing that some simple text retrieval approaches had better results than these more complex query expansion approaches. This year we decided to revisit our basic text retrieval approaches and see how they would stack up against the various expansion approaches used by other groups. The results are now in and the answer is clear, they perform pretty badly compared to other groups' approaches. All of the runs submitted were performed using the Cheshire II system. This year the Berkeley/Cheshire group submitted a total of twenty-four runs, including two for each subtask of the DS track. These include six Monolingual runs for English, German, and Russian, twelve Bilingual runs (four X2EN, four X2DE, and four X2RU), and six Multilingual runs (two EN, two DE, and two RU). The overall results include Cheshire runs in the top five participants for each task, but usually as the lowest of the five (and often fewer) groups.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saravanan, M.</author><author>Ravindran, B.</author><author>Raman, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving Legal Information Retrieval Using An Ontological Framework</title><secondary-title>Artificial Intelligence and Law</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Artificial Intelligence and Law</full-title></periodical><pages>101-124</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Information retrieval</keyword><keyword>Knowledge base</keyword><keyword>Legal ontology</keyword><keyword>Query enhancement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10506-009-9075-y</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>A variety of legal documents are increasingly being made available in electronic format. Automatic Information Search and Retrieval algorithms play a key role in enabling efficient access to such digitized documents. Although keyword-based search is the traditional method used for text retrieval, they perform poorly when literal term matching is done for query processing, due to synonymy and ambivalence of words. To overcome these drawbacks, an ontological framework to enhance the user‚Äôs query for retrieval of truly relevant legal judgments has been proposed in this paper. Ontologies ensure efficient retrieval by enabling inferences based on domain knowledge, which is gathered during the construction of the knowledge base. Empirical results demonstrate that ontology-based searches generate significantly better results than traditional search methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beck, H W</author><author>Gala, S K</author><author>Navathe, S B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classification as a query processing technique in the {CANDIDE} semantic data model</title><secondary-title>Fifth {International} {Conference} on {Data} {Engineering}, 1989. {Proceedings}</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fifth {International} {Conference} on {Data} {Engineering}, 1989. {Proceedings}</full-title></periodical><pages>572-581</pages><keywords><keyword>Algebra</keyword><keyword>BACK</keyword><keyword>CANDIDE semantic data model</keyword><keyword>Data models</keyword><keyword>Database Management Systems</keyword><keyword>Database languages</keyword><keyword>Database systems</keyword><keyword>Deductive databases</keyword><keyword>FL-1</keyword><keyword>Information retrieval</keyword><keyword>KANDOR</keyword><keyword>Knowledge representation</keyword><keyword>Logic</keyword><keyword>Natural languages</keyword><keyword>POPLOG</keyword><keyword>Research and development</keyword><keyword>Spatial databases</keyword><keyword>Taxonomy</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>classification algorithm</keyword><keyword>data objects</keyword><keyword>data-description language</keyword><keyword>data-manipulation language</keyword><keyword>frame-based knowledge representation languages</keyword><keyword>integrated natural-language query system</keyword><keyword>knowledge based systems</keyword><keyword>knowledge-base management system</keyword><keyword>object taxonomy</keyword><keyword>query languages</keyword><keyword>query objects</keyword><keyword>query processing</keyword><keyword>query processing technique</keyword><keyword>relational algebra</keyword><keyword>subsumption</keyword><keyword>view objects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1989</year></dates><isbn>0-8186-1915-5</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICDE.1989.47264</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The use of classification and subsumption to process database queries is discussed.

In this work we introduce novel expanded term adequacy measures related to term frequency and inverse document frequency in relevant and non-relevant groups of documents. Term evaluation scores are derived using two term characteristics: inverse term representativeness and term usability. We generate the Optimal Queries based on the documents contents and the Qrels files of data used in the Text Retrieval Conference 2016 ‚Äì Clinical Decision Support track (TREC-CDS 2016). The improvement can be up to a factor of 2 depending on the evaluation measure.

Other sentences and paragraphs were shown in a smaller font. This allowed the user to very easily find and read relevant passages while ignoring intervening and mostly irrelevant text. Users could define new areas of interest in the document with a mouse click thereby returning those areas to a normal sized font.

When searching for specific information (as opposed to browsing), users can get disoriented in large hypertext documents and may end up following a path that takes them further away from the information they seek. This paper describes an information retrieval system called HRS (Hyper-text Retrieval System) that allows users to retrieve information in hypertext documents based on its semantic content. HRS is comprised of an authoring system, a browser, and a graph-based information retrieval facility. The graph-based retrieval facility allows users to retrieve specific information in hypertext documents by posing English language queries. The retrieval facility is based on the use of Conceptual Graphs, a knowledge representation scheme. The English language queries posed by users are automatically converted to Conceptual Graphs by a parser. The information in hypertext documents is also represented using Conceptual Graphs. Query processing is treated as a graph matching process, and retrieval is performed by a semantic based search. The technology is useful for retrieval of information in large knowledge domains where a user needs to find specific information and does not know the organisation of the hypertext document or the words used in the document. The paper concludes that natural language retrieval of information in hypertext documents can provide users with both the browsing capabilities of hypertext and the semantic search capabilities of natural language query processing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mills, Chris</author><author>Haiduc, Sonia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A machine learning approach for determining the validity of traceability links</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion, ICSE-C 2017</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion, ICSE-C 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>121-123</pages><keywords><keyword>Classification</keyword><keyword>Supervised machine learning</keyword><keyword>Text retrieval</keyword><keyword>Traceability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>9781538615898</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.86</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) is a fundamental software maintenance task in which links are established between related software artifacts of different types (e.g., source code, documentation, requirements specifications, etc.) within a system.

Classic IRSs based on this paradigm [Smith, M., &amp; Smith, M. (1997). The use of genetic programming to build Boolean queries for text retrieval through relevance feedback. Journal of Information Science, 23(6), 423-431] generate a single solution (Boolean query) in each run, that with the best fitness value, which is usually based on a weighted combination of the basic performance criteria, precision and recall. A desirable aspect of IRSs, especially of those based on the IQBE paradigm, is to be able to get more than one query for the same information needs, with high precision arid recall values or with different trade-offs between both. In this contribution, a new IQBE process is proposed combining a previous basic algorithm to automatically derive Boolean queries for Boolean IRSs [Smith, M., &amp; Smith, M. (1997). The use of genetic programming to build Boolean queries for text retrieval through relevance feedback. Journal of Information Science, 23(6), 423-431] and an advanced evolutionary multiobjective approach [Coello, C. A., Van Veldhuizen, D. A., &amp; Lamant, G. B. (2002). Evolutionary algorithms for solving multiobjective problems. Kluwer Academic Publishers], which obtains several queries with a different precision-recall trade-off in a single run. The performance of the new proposal will be tested on the Cranfield and CACM collections and compared to the well-known Smith and Smith's algorithm, showing how it improves the learning of queries and thus it could better assist the user in the query formulation process. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We have participated in three tracks of CLIR, Filtering and QA. We have submitted four runs for CLIR track. Bilingual knowledge source and statistical-based search engine are integrated in our CLIR system. We varied our strategy somewhat between runs: long query (both title and description field of the queries involved) with pseudo relevance feedback (FDUT9XL1), long query with no feedback (FDUT9XL2), median query (just description field of queries involved) with feedback (FDUT9XL3) and, the last, mono long query with feedback (FDUT9XL4). For filtering, we participate in the sub-task of adaptive filtering and batch filtering. Vector representation and computation are heavily applied in filtering procedure. 11 runs of various combination of topic and evaluation measure have been submitted: 4 OHSU runs, 1 MeSH run and 2 MSH-SAMPLE runs for adaptive filtering, and 2 OHSU runs, 1 MeSH run and 1 MSH-SAMPLE run for batch filtering. Our QA system consists of three components: Question Analyzer, Candidate Window Searcher and Answer Extractor. We submitted two runs in the 50-byte category and two runs in the 250-byte category. The runs of &quot;FDUT9QL1&quot; and &quot;FDUT9QS1&quot; are extracted from the top 100 candidate windows. The other two runs of &quot;FDUT9QL2&quot; and &quot;FDUT9QS1&quot; are extracted from the top 24 candidate windows. 1. Cross-Language IR We focused our attention on Chinese document indexing and query translation. All query processing was fully automatic and both long and short query translation are covered. Our overall strategy to CLIR task is to translate English query into Chinese word list, since we feel it is not feasible to build a document translation system in such a short period, while it is much more reasonable to disambiguate word sense in context of long query by statistical approach, such as POS and knowledge. Once queries have been translated, we use IR techniques, which is a variant of MIT's approach[1] and probabilistic methods to obtain relevant document list.

A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laborit, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Le th????tre vu dans l'optique de la biologie des comportements.</title><secondary-title>Agressologie</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Agressologie</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1980</year></dates><urls/><abstract>The Inductive Query By Example (IQBE) paradigm allows a system to automatically derive queries for a specific Information Retrieval System (IRS). Classic IRSs based on this paradigm [Smith, M., &amp; Smith, M. (1997). The use of genetic programming to build Boolean queries for text retrieval through relevance feedback. Journal of Information Science, 23(6), 423-431] generate a single solution (Boolean query) in each run, that with the best fitness value, which is usually based on a weighted combination of the basic performance criteria, precision and recall.A desirable aspect of IRSs, especially of those based on the IQBE paradigm, is to be able to get more than one query for the same information needs, with high precision arid recall values or with different trade-offs between both.In this contribution, a new IQBE process is proposed combining a previous basic algorithm to automatically derive Boolean queries for Boolean IRSs [Smith, M., &amp; Smith, M.

The performance of the new proposal will be tested on the Cranfield and CACM collections and compared to the well-known Smith and Smith's algorithm, showing how it improves the learning of queries and thus it could better assist the user in the query formulation process.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>STEMPFHUBER, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptive and Context-Aware Information Environments Based on ODIN - Using Semantic and Task Knowledge for User Interface Adaptation in Information Systems</title><secondary-title>Human-Automation Interaction: Research &amp; Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human-Automation Interaction: Research &amp; Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>864-868</pages><keywords><keyword>08-04-00: General Information layout and format</keyword><keyword>17-00-00: General Database Organisation and Data R</keyword><keyword>20-02-00: General Interface management systems and</keyword><keyword>37-02-00: System adaptability and flexibility</keyword><keyword>distributed systems</keyword><keyword>information systems</keyword><keyword>libraries</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://ezproxy.net.ucf.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ega&amp;AN=ega198601&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the context of digital libraries, where a large set of heterogeneous and distributed information is accessible to users with different backgrounds and expertise, designing a 'user interface for all' becomes a complex task. The result is often a tendency either to fall back on the least common denominator - and neglect the demands of many users - or to put everything in a single, very complex user interface. In both cases, the limitations of the user interface will have a negative influence on user satisfaction. With ODIN the author presents a framework for designing object-oriented, dynamic user interfaces which has been developed in the context of information systems for text documents, time-series data and geographic data. Systems based on ODIN use a model of the semantic dependencies of the application domain to dynamically adapt the user interface to optimize screen layout and information density. The adaptation is subject to the principles of tight coupling and loose coupling, which describe the dependencies between elements of the user interface and the data. Design patterns are used to define both principles and to guide selection and implementation of the principles. The author extensively uses visual formalisms for displaying semantic relationships in the data, for interactive exploration of query results and for query refinement. The elements of ODIN have already been tested in the domains of text retrieval and urban planning and are currently being re-designed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khazaei, Taraneh</author><author>Hoeber, Orland</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metadata visualization of scholarly search results</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies - i-KNOW '12</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies - i-KNOW '12</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>9781450312424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/2362456.2362483</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2362456.2362483</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Studies of online search behaviour have found that searchers often face difficulties formulating queries and exploring the search results sets.

However, when searchers are asked to describe their image needs, the resulting query is often short and potentially ambiguous. The solution we propose is to perform automatic query expansion using Wikipedia as the source knowledge base, resulting in a diversification of the search results. The outcome is a broad range of images that represent the various possible interpretations of the query. In order to assist the searcher in finding images that match their specific intentions for the query, we have developed an image organization method that uses both the conceptual information associated with each image, and the visual features extracted from the images. This, coupled with a hierarchical organization of the concepts, provides an interactive interface that takes advantage of the searchers' abilities to recognize relevant concepts, filter and focus the search results based on these concepts, and visually identify relevant images while navigating within the image space. In this paper, we outline the key features of our image retrieval system (CIDER), and present the results of a preliminary user evaluation. The results of this study illustrate the potential benefits that CIDER can provide for searchers conducting image retrieval tasks. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A major obstacle in association rule mining is that often a huge number of rules are generated even with very reasonable support and confidence. The main challenge of using AR in information retrieval (IR) is to select the rules that are related to the query, since many of them are trivial, redundant or semantically wrong. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling medical query contexts based on mining semantic-based AR for improving clinical text retrieval. We semantically index the EMR with concepts of UMLS ontology. First, the concepts in the query context are derived from the rules that cover the query and then weighted according to their semantic relatedness to the query concepts. The query context is then exploited to re-rank patients records for improving clinical retrieval performance. We evaluate our approach on the medical TREC dataset. Results show that our proposed approach allows performing better retrieval performance than the probabilistic BM25 model.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Momtazi, Saeedeh</author><author>Naumann, Felix</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Topic modeling for expert finding using latent Dirichlet allocation</title><secondary-title>Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</full-title></periodical><pages>346-353</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>19424787</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/widm.1102</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The task of expert finding is to rank the experts in the search space given a field of expertise as an input query. In this paper, we propose a topic modeling approach for this task. The proposed model uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to induce probabilistic topics. In the first step of our algorithm, the main topics of a document collection are extracted using LDA. The extracted topics present the connection between expert candidates and user queries. In the second step, the topics are used as a bridge to find the probability of selecting each candidate for a given query. The candidates are then ranked based on these probabilities. The experimental results on the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Enterprise track for 2005 and 2006 show that the proposed topic-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art profile- and document-based models, which use information retrieval methods to rank experts. Moreover, we present the superiority of the proposed topic-based approach to the improved document-based expert finding systems, which consider additional information such as local context, candidate prior, and query expansion.

Hence, managing both in an efficient and integrated manner has received much attention from both the IR and database communities. To date, however, little research has been devoted to semantic issues in the integration of text and data. In this paper we introduced a problem in this realm: entity retrieval. Given data fragments that describe various aspects of a real-world entity, find all other data fragments as well as text documents that describe that same entity. As such, entity retrieval is a novel retrieval problem, which differs from both regular text retrieval and database search in that it explicitly requires matching information at the semantic level; matching syntactically as done in the current search engines and relational databases would be inherently non-optimal. We define entity retrieval and conduct a case study of retrieving information about a researcher from both the Web and a bibliographic database (DBLP). We propose several methods for exploiting the structured information in the database to improve entity retrieval over the text collection. Specifically, we present a query expansion mechanism based on extracted information from structured data. Experiment results show that selectively using more structured information to expand the text query improves entity retrieval performance on text. We conclude the paper with future research directions for entity retrieval.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Croft, W Bruce</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NSF Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval.</title><secondary-title>Communications of the ACM</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Communications of the ACM</full-title></periodical><pages>42-43</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>INFORMATION resources</keyword><keyword>INFORMATION resources management</keyword><keyword>INFORMATION storage &amp; retrieval systems</keyword><keyword>MASSACHUSETTS</keyword><keyword>RESEARCH institutes</keyword><keyword>TECHNOLOGY transfer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/205323.205328</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=9504211521&amp;site=ehost-live</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This article focuses on the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) of the National Science Foundation/Industry University Collaborative Research Centers program.  CIIR was started at the University of Massachusetts in 1993 to do research and technology transfer in the area of distributed, text-based information systems. The center relies on government and industrial partners, in addition to federal funding. The goals of the CIIR include the development of advanced techniques for text analysis and retrieval, and the integration of those techniques with other data management techniques in distributed environments. The term text-based information system is used to describe a system which supports applications with databases containing mainly text. The CIIR supports research projects in areas such as advanced retrieval techniques, indexing and natural language processing, routing and filtering and browsing and query formulation. A number of digital library projects involving collaboration between the CIIR and its members are underway. For CIIR, a digital library application is synonymous with a distributed, text-based, multimedia information system. The initial prototype of the American Memory project with the Library of Congress has used a Mosaic interface that incorporates some aspects of an advanced text retrieval. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Commerce is working with the CIIR to provide access to the National Trade Database and related information.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hou, Yuexian</author><author>Zhao, Xiaozhao</author><author>Song, Dawei</author><author>Li, Wenjie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mining pure high-order word associations via information geometry for information retrieval</title><secondary-title>ACM Transactions on Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACM Transactions on Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1-32</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/2493175.2493177</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2493175.2493177</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The classical bag-of-word models for information retrieval (IR) fail to capture contextual associations between words. In this article, we propose to investigate pure high-order dependence among a number of words forming an unseparable semantic entity, that is, the high-order dependence that cannot be reduced to the random coincidence of lower-order dependencies. We believe that identifying these pure high-order dependence patterns would lead to a better representation of documents and novel retrieval models. Specifically, two formal definitions of pure dependence--unconditional pure dependence (UPD) and conditional pure dependence (CPD)--are defined. The exact decision on UPD and CPD, however, is NP-hard in general. We hence derive and prove the sufficient criteria that entail UPD and CPD, within the well-principled information geometry (IG) framework, leading to a more feasible UPD/CPD identification procedure. We further develop novel methods for extracting word patterns with pure high-order dependence. Our methods are applied to and extensively evaluated on three typical IR tasks: text classification and text retrieval without and with query expansion.

Our main efforts concern the expansion of the image metadata from the Wikipedia abstracts collection DBpedia. Since the metadata is short for retrieval by query words, we decided to expand the metadata using a typical query expansion method. In our experiments, we use the Rocchio algorithm for document expansion. Our best run is in the 26th rank of all 57 runs which is under our expectation, and we think that the main reason is that our document expansion method uses all the words from the metadata documents which contain words which are unrelated to the content of the images. Compared with our text retrieval baseline, our best document expansion run improves MAP by 11.17%. As one of our conclusions, we think that the document expansion can play an effective factor in the image metadata retrieval task. Our content-based image retrieval uses the same approach as in our participation in Image CLEF 2008.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bedrick, Steven</author><author>Sheikshabbafghi, Golnar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lucene, MetaMap, and language modeling: OHSU at CLEF eHealth 2013</title><secondary-title>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</full-title></periodical><volume>1179</volume><keywords><keyword>Language model</keyword><keyword>Lucene</keyword><keyword>MetaMap</keyword><keyword>Skip-grams</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>16130073</isbn><urls/><abstract>The Oregon Health Science University team's participation in task #3 (&quot;addressing patients' medical questions&quot;) of this year's eHealth CLEF campaign included submissions from two different retrieval systems.

We submitted three runs in total; one from the novel system, and two from our Lucene-based system, one of which made use of the National Library of Medicine's MetaMap tool to perform query expansion. In general, our runs did not perform particularly well, although there were several topics for which our language model-based retrieval system produced the best P@10.

As distinct from the bag-of-feature based methods, we do not regard descriptor quantizations as &quot;visual words&quot;. Instead a group of selected SIFT features of an object together with their spatial arrangement are represented by an attributed graph. Each graph is then regarded as a &quot;visual word&quot;. We measure the similarity between graphs using the similarity of SIFT features and the compatibility of their arrangement. Using the similarity measure we efficiently identify the set of K nearest neighbor graphs (KNNG) using a SOM based clustering tree. We then extend the concept of &quot;query expansion&quot; widely used in text retrieval to develop a graph clustering method based on pairwise similarity propagation (SPGC), in that the trained KNNG information is utilized for speeding up. Using SOM based clustering tree and SPGC, we develop a framework for scalable object indexing and retrieval. We illustrate these ideas on a database of over 50K images spanning more than 500 objects. We show that the precision is substantially boosted, achieving total recall in many cases. 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karamuftuoglu, Murat</author><author>Jones, Susan</author><author>Robertson, Stephen</author><author>Venuti, Fabio</author><author>Wang, Xinkun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Challenges posed by web-based retrieval of scientific papers: Okapi participation in TIPS</title><secondary-title>Journal of Information Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Information Science</full-title></periodical><pages>3-17</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/016555150202800102</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This paper reviews some of the past Okapi research and discusses the role of Okapi in the current TIPS project.

In this context, extraction of indexing units from formatted document sources, user interface design, implementation of field searching and query expansion within the framework of probabilistic searching are discussed. The problem of maintaining session continuity in the web environment and a possible solution to this problem are outlined. Other challenges posed by the open nature of the web environment are also indicated. These include the difficulty of delimiting the boundaries of a search session and the potential of the web for collaborative information retrieval. A system for collaboratively filtering documents based on their contents is described in this connection.

Besides the Vector Space Model (VSM) that we have been using since INEX 2006, this year we implemented the Language Modeling (LM) approach in our text retrieval system (SMART) to retrieve XML elements against the INEX Adhoc queries. Like last year, we considered Content-Only (CO) queries and submitted three runs for the FOCUSED sub-task. Two runs are based on the Vector Space Model and one uses the Language Model. One of the VSM-based runs (VSMfbElts0.4) retrieves sub-document-level elements. Both the other runs (VSMfb and LM-nofb-0.20) retrieve elements only at the whole-document level. We applied blind feedback for both the VSM-based runs; no query expansion was used in the LM-based run. In general, the relative performance of our document-level runs is respectable (ranked 15/61 and 22/61 according to the official metric). Though our element retrieval run does reasonably (ranked 16/61 by iP[0.01]) according to the early-precision metrics, we think there is plenty of scope to improve our element retrieval strategy. Our immediate next task is therefore to focus on how to improve true element-level retrieval. &amp;copy; 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Garci√°-Contreras, Isabel</author><author>Morales, Jos√© F.</author><author>Hermenegildo, Manuel V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Semantic code browsing</title><secondary-title>Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</full-title></periodical><pages>721-737</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>5-6</issue><keywords><keyword>Abstract Interpretation</keyword><keyword>Assertions</keyword><keyword>Semantic Code Search</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1471068416000</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S1471068416000417</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Programmers currently enjoy access to a very high number of code repositories and libraries of ever increasing size. The ensuing potential for reuse is however hampered by the fact that searching within all this code becomes an increasingly difficult task. Most code search engines are based on syntactic techniques such as signature matching or keyword extraction. However, these techniques are inaccurate (because they basically rely on documentation) and at the same time do not offer very expressive code query languages. We propose a novel approach that focuses on querying for semantic characteristics of code obtained automatically from the code itself. Program units are pre-processed using static analysis techniques, based on abstract interpretation, obtaining safe semantic approximations. A novel, assertion-based code query language is used to express desired semantic characteristics of the code as partial specifications. Relevant code is found by comparing such partial specifications with the inferred semantics for program elements. Our approach is fully automatic and does not rely on user annotations or documentation. It is more powerful and flexible than signature matching because it is parametric on the abstract domain and properties, and does not require type definitions. Also, it reasons with relations between properties, such as implication and abstraction, rather than just equality. It is also more resilient to syntactic code differences. We describe the approach and report on a prototype implementation within the Ciao system.

Processing of normal text is easier and information can be retrieved efficiently. There are plenty of algorithms in hand to carry out the normal text retrieval. Whereas retrieving geospatial information is very complex and requires additional operations to be performed. Since geospatial data contain complex details than general data such as location, direction. To handle geographical queries, we proposed a Density Probabilistic Document Correlation (DPDC) approach. This approach, initially categorize the geographical features from text that satisfies the given queries. Existing text classification techniques are unsuitable for geospatial text classification due to the exclusivity of the geographical features. Depending on the DPDC approach result we predict overlap of the feature set for a document. Based on overlap and document correlation, the documents are ranked. Highly relevant documents are extracted depending on the score obtained through ranking. Documents with high score are considered the most relevant. The experimental results show that our proposed method efficiently retrieves the list of relevant documents. ¬© 2013 Science Publications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clough, Paul</author><author>Grubinger, Michael</author><author>Deselaers, Thomas</author><author>Hanbury, Allan</author><author>M√ºller, Henning</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overview of the ImageCLEF 2006 photographic retrieval and object annotation tasks</title><secondary-title>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CEUR Workshop Proceedings</full-title></periodical><volume>1172</volume><keywords><keyword>Image classification</keyword><keyword>Image retrieval</keyword><keyword>Performance evaluation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>9783540749981</isbn><urls/><abstract>This paper describes the general photographic retrieval and object annotation tasks of the ImageCLEF 2006 evaluation campaign. These tasks provide both the resources and the framework necessary to perform comparative laboratory-style evaluation of visual information systems for image retrieval and automatic image annotation. Both tasks offer something new for 2006 and attracted a large number of submissions: 12 groups participating in ImageCLEFphoto and 3 in the automatic annotation task. This paper summarises components used in the benchmark, including the collections, the search and annotation tasks, the submissions from participating groups, and results. The general photographic retrieval task, ImageCLEFphoto, used a new collection-the IAPR-TC12 Benchmark-of 20,000 colour photographs with semi-structured captions in English and German. This new collection replaces the St Andrews collection of historic photographs used for the previous three years. For ImageCLEFphoto groups submitted mainly text-only runs. However, 31% of runs involved some kind of visual retrieval technique, typically combined with text through the merging of image and text retrieval results. Bilingual text retrieval was performed using two target languages: English and German, with 59% of runs bilingual. Highest monolingual of English was shown to be 74% for Portuguese-English and 39% of German for English-German. Combined text and retrieval approaches were seen to give, on average, higher retrieval results (+54%) than using text (or image) retrieval alone. Similar to previous years, the use of relevance feedback (most commonly in the form of pseudo relevance feedback) to enable query expansion was seen to improve the text-based submissions by an average of 39%. Topics have been categorised and analysed with respect to various attributes including an estimation of their &quot;visualness&quot; and linguistic complexity. The general automatic object annotation task used a hand collected dataset of 81,211 images from 268 classes provided by LTUtech. Given training data, participants were required to classify previously unseen images. The error rate of submissions for this task was high (ranging from 77.3% to 93.2%) resulting in a large proportion of test images being misclassified by any of the proposed classification methods. The task can therefore be said to have been very challenging for participants.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Castano, Silvana</author><author>De Antonellis, Valeria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discovery-based approach to database ontology design</title><secondary-title>Distributed and Parallel Databases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Distributed and Parallel Databases</full-title></periodical><pages>67-98</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1999</year></dates><isbn>0926-8782</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1008686328306</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In this paper, we introduce an approach to task-driven ontology design which is based on information discovery from database schemas. Techniques for semi-automatically discovering terms and relationships used in the information space, denoting concepts, their properties and links are proposed, which are applied in two stages. At the first stage, the focus is on the discovery of heterogeneity/ambiguity of data representations in different schemas. For this purpose, schema elements are compared according to defined comparison features and similarity coefficients are evaluated. This stage produces a set of candidates for unification into ontology concepts. At the second stage, decisions are made on which candidates to unify into concepts and on how to relate concepts by semantic links. Ontology concepts and links can be accessed according to different perspectives, so that the ontology can serve different purposes, such as, providing a search space for powerful mechanisms for concept location, setting a basis for query formulation and processing, and establishing a reference for recognizing terminological relationships between elements in different schemas.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, H.a</author><author>Song, W.a</author><author>Mine, T.b</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>APIBook - An effective approach for finding APIs</title><secondary-title>ACM International Conference Proceeding Series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACM International Conference Proceeding Series</full-title></periodical><pages>45-53</pages><volume>18-Septemb</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>9781450348294</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/2993717.2993727</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995513582&amp;doi=10.1145%2F2993717.2993727&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3e5c8a63af82dfeb7dd5b55bb697c842</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Software libraries have become more and more complex in recent years.

Automated IR tools are used to reduce the size of a corpus search space to produce smaller sets of documents to be reviewed. However, a limitation associated with automated tools is they mainly employ statistical use of search terms that can result in poor performance when measured by recall and precision. One reason for this limitation is that relevance - the quality of matching a document to user criteria - is dynamic and fluid, whereas a query - representing the translation of a user's IR goal - is fixed. This paper reports on a design approach to eDiscovey that combines concept and context modeling to enhance search term performance. We apply this approach to the TREC 2011 Legal Track Problem Set #401. Our goal is to improve performance in eDiscovery IR results.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramirez-Como, Magaly</author><author>Balderrama, Victor Samuel</author><author>Estrada, Magali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance parameters degradation of inverted organic solar cells exposed under solar and artificial irradiance, using PTB7:PC70BM as active layer</title><secondary-title>2016 13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering,Computing Science and Automatic Control, CCE 2016</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2016 13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering,Computing Science and Automatic Control, CCE 2016</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Degradation mechanisms</keyword><keyword>PTB7:PC70BM active layer</keyword><keyword>life time</keyword><keyword>solar irradiance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>9781509035106</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICEEE.2016.7751205</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This dissertation studies the challenges faced in supporting scenario-specific medical free-text retrieval with documents in online textual databases. A scenario is typically defined as a frequently-reappearing medical task. Scenario-specific queries are important because recent studies reveal that such queries prevail in clinical practice. We concern ourselves with answering scenario-specific queries using online textual databases, since such databases have become the most valuable information sources in the medical domain. Although the amount of information in such databases increases rapidly and the quality of such information is high, the utilization of these databases in clinical practice is low because of the following major challenges, which are not handled well by existing retrieval systems. The first challenge is to automatically identify relevant databases with high accuracy. Towards this goal, we first develop a probabilistic relevancy model which estimates the relevancy of each database more accurately than traditional models. We further develop an adaptive probing technique that contacts a few databases on the fly to obtain their exact relevancy measures, and consequently to select the best databases with higher accuracy. The second challenge in our study is to resolve query-document mismatch, mismatch between the general scenario terms in a query and specialized terms in relevant documents. We propose a knowledge-based query expansion technique which, based on a domain knowledge source, automatically identifies the specialized concepts specifically related to the original query's scenario. The technique further expands such specialized concepts to the original query, making the query a better match with relevant documents and leading to improved retrieval effectiveness.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dahab, Mohamed Yehia</author><author>Kamel, Mahmoud</author><author>Alnofaie, Sara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An empirical study of documents information retrieval using DWT</title><secondary-title>Studies in Computational Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in Computational Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>251-264</pages><volume>740</volume><keywords><keyword>Haar and Daubechies wavelet transform algorithms</keyword><keyword>Information retrieval</keyword><keyword>Term proximity</keyword><keyword>Term signal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1860949X (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-67056-0_13</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Most of the information retrieval models represent documents as bag-of words which takes into account the term frequencies (tf) and inverse document frequencies (idf). However, most of these models ignore the distance among query terms in the documents (i.e. term proximity). Several researches have appeared in recent years using the term proximity among query terms to increase the efficiency of document retrieval. To solve proximity problem, several researches have implemented tools to specify term proximity at the query formulation level. They rank documents based on the relative positions of the query terms within the documents. They should store all proximity data in the index, affecting on the size of index, which slows down the search process. In the last decade, many researches provided models that use term signal representation to represent a query term, the query is transformed from the time domain into the frequency domain using transformation techniques such as wavelet. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), such as Haar and Daubechies, uses multiple resolutions technique by which different frequencies are analyzed with different resolutions. The advantage of the DWT is to consider the spatial information of the query terms within the document rather than using only the count of terms. In this chapter, in order to improve ranking score as well as improve the run-time efficiency to resolve the query, and maintain a reasonable space for the index, two different discrete wavelet transform algorithms have been applied namely: Haar and Daubechies, three different types of spectral analysis based on semantic segmentation are carried out namely: sentence-based segmentation, paragraph-based segmentation and fixed length segmentation; and also different term weighting is performed according to term position. The experiments were constructed using the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) collection. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marton, Christine F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Salton and Buckley's landmark research in experimental text information retrieval</title><secondary-title>Evidence Based Library and Information Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Evidence Based Library and Information Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>169-176</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.18438/B87032</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Objectives ‚Äì To compare the performance of the vector space model and the probabilistic weighting model of relevance feedback for the overall purpose of determining the most useful relevance feedback procedures. The amount of improvement that can be obtained from searching several test document collections with only one feedback iteration of each relevance feedback model was measured.&amp;#13; &amp;#13; Design ‚Äì The experimental design consisted of 72 different tests: 2 different relevance feedback methods, each with 6 permutations, on 6 test document collections of various sizes. A residual collection method was utilized to ascertain the ‚Äútrue advantage provided by the relevance feedback process.‚Äù (Salton &amp;amp; Buckley, 1990, p. 293)&amp;#13; Setting ‚Äì Department of Computer Science at Cornell University.&amp;#13; &amp;#13; Subjects ‚Äì Six test document collections.&amp;#13; &amp;#13; Methods ‚Äì Relevance feedback is an effective technique for query modification that provides significant improvement in search performance. Relevance feedback entails both ‚Äúterm reweighting,‚Äù the modification of term weights based on term use in retrieved relevant and non-relevant documents, and ‚Äúquery expansion,‚Äù which is the addition of new terms from relevant documents retrieved (Harman, 1992). &amp;#13; &amp;#13; Salton and Buckley (1990) evaluated two established relevance feedback models based on the vector space model (a spatial model) and the probabilistic model, respectively. Harman (1992) describes the two key differences between these competing models of relevance feedback. &amp;#13; [The vector space model merges] document vectors and original query vectors. This automatically reweights query terms by adding the weights from the actual occurrence of those query terms in the relevant documents, and subtracting the weights of those terms occurring in the non-relevant documents. Queries are automatically expanded by adding all the terms not in the original query that are in the relevant documents and non-relevant documents. They are expanded using both positive and negative weights based on whether the terms are coming from relevant or non-relevant documents. Yet, no new terms are actually added with negative weights; the contribution of non-relevant document terms is to modify the weighting of new terms coming from relevant documents. . . . The probabilistic model . . . is based on the distribution of query terms in relevant and non-relevant documents, This is expressed as a term weight, with the rank of each retrieved document then being the sum of the term weights for terms contained in the document that match query terms. (pp. 1-2)&amp;#13; &amp;#13; Second, while the vector space model ‚Äúhas an inherent relationship between term reweighting and query expansion‚Äù (p. 2), the probabilistic model does not. Thus, query expansion is optional, but given its usefulness, various schemes have been proposed for expanding queries using terms from retrieved relevant documents.&amp;#13; &amp;#13; In the Salton and Buckley study 3 versions of each of the two relevance feedback methods were utilized, with two different levels of query expansion, and run on 6 different test collections. More specifically, they queried test collections that ranged in size from small to large, and that represented different domains of knowledge, including medicine and engineering with 72 experimental runs in total. &amp;#13; &amp;#13; Salton and Buckley examined 3 variants of the vector space model, the second and third of which were based on the first. The first model was the classic Rocchio algorithm (1971), which uses reduced document weights to modify the queries. The second model was the ‚ÄúIde regular‚Äù algorithm, which reweights both relevant and non-relevant query terms (Ide, 1971). And the third model was the ‚ÄúIde dec-hi‚Äù algorithm, which reweights all identified relevant items but only one retrieved nonrelevant item, the one retrieved first in the initial set of search results (Ide &amp;amp; Salton, 1971). &amp;#13; &amp;#13; As well, 3 variants of the probabilistic model developed by S.E. Robertson (Robertson, 1986; Robertson &amp;amp; Spark Jones, 1976; Robertson, van Rijsbergen, &amp;amp; Porter, 1981; Yu, Buckley, Lam, &amp;amp; Salton, 1983) were examined: the conventional probabilistic approach with a 0.5 adjustment factor, the adjusted probabilistic derivation with a different adjustment factor, and finally an adjusted derivation with enhanced query term weights. The 6 vector space model and probabilistic model relevance feedback techniques are described in Table 3 (p. 293).&amp;#13; &amp;#13; The performance of the first iteration feedback searches were compared solely with the results of the initial searches performed with the original query statements. The first 15 documents retrieved from the initial searches were judged for relevance by the researchers and the terms contained in these relevant and non-relevant retrieved items were used to construct the feedback queries. The authors utilized the residual collection system, which entails the removal of all items previously seen by the searcher (whether relevant or not), and to evaluate both the initial and any subsequent queries for the reduced collection only.&amp;#13; &amp;#13; Both multi-valued (partial) and binary weights (1=relevant, 0=non-relevant) were used on the document terms (Table 6, p. 296). Also, two types of query expansion method were applied: expanded by the most common terms and expanded by all terms (Table 4, p. 294). While not using any query expansion and relying solely on reweighting relevant and non-relevant query terms is possible, this option was not examined. Three measures were calculated to assess relative relevance feedback performance, the rank order (recall-precision value); search precision (with respect to the average precision at 3 particular recall points of 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25), and the percentage improvement in the 3-point precision feedback and original searches. &amp;#13; &amp;#13; Main Results ‚Äì The best results are produced by the same relevance feedback models for all test collections examined, and conversely, the poorest results are produced by the same relevance feedback models, (Tables 4, 5, and 6, pp. 294-296). In other words, all 3 relevance feedback algorithms based on the vector space retrieval model outperformed the 3 relevance feedback algorithms based on the probabilistic retrieval model, with the best relevance feedback results obtained for the ‚ÄúIde dec hi‚Äù model. This finding suggests that improvements in relevance from term reweighting are attributable primarily to reweighting relevant terms. However, the probabilistic method with adjusted derivation, specifically considering the extra weight assignments for query terms, was almost as effective as the vector space model relevance feedback algorithms. &amp;#13; &amp;#13; Paired comparisons between full query expansion (all terms from the initial search are utilized in the feedback query) and partial query expansion by the most common terms from the relevant items, demonstrate that full expansion is better, however, the difference between expansion methods is small. &amp;#13; &amp;#13; Conclusions ‚Äì Relevance feedback methods that reformulate the initial query by reweighting existing query terms and adding new terms (query expansion) can greatly improve the relevance of search results after only one feedback iteration. The amount of improvement achieved was highly variable across the 6 test collections, from 50% to 150% in the 3-point precision. Other variables thought to influence relevance feedback performance were initial query length, characteristics of the collection, including the specificity of the terms in the collection, the size of the collection (number of documents), and average term frequency in documents. The authors recommend that the relevance feedback process be incorporated into operational text retrieval systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aquino, Angelica M</author><author>Chavez, Enrico P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis on the use of Latent Semantic Indexing ( LSI ) for document classification and retrieval system of PNP files</title><secondary-title>MATEC Web of Conferences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MATEC Web of Conferences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-</pages><volume>189</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1051/matecconf/201818903009</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Document classification is the process of categorizing documents from many mixed files automatically [1]. In this paper, an approach to classification of documents for admin-case files of Philippine National Police (PNP) using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) method is proposed. The model for this that represents term-to-term, document-todocument and term-to-document relationships has been applied. Regular Expression is implemented also to define a search pattern based on character strings which the LSI used to establish the semantic relevance of the character strings to the search term or keyword. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of LSI in classifying PNP documents; experimentation was done using software to test the capability of LSI towards text retrieval. Indexing is according to the pattern matched in the collection of text that uses model of SVD. Based on tests, documents were indexed based on file relationships and was able to return a search result as the retrieved information from PNP files. Weights are used to check the accuracy of the method; the positive values identified in query similarity are regarded as the most relevant among the related searches, meaning, the query word matches words in a text file and it returns a query result.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fan, B.</author><author>Onteru, S.

Interestingly, it has been observed in both experimental and field conditions that leg weakness has increased over time, concurrent with the selection for improved rate of lean gain, while fatter animals tend to have better leg action, and foot and leg (FL) structure. The exact molecular mechanisms or individual genes responsible for this apparent genetic correlation between fatness and leg weakness and other physical adaptability traits have been less well reported. Based on our recent studies involving candidate genes and leg weakness traits, the present investigation has identified 30 SNPs from 26 genes that were found to be associated with 10th rib backfat in a sow population consisting of 2066 animals. The specific alleles associated with increased backfat tended to be associated with better overall leg action, as shown for the genes including MTHFR, WNT2, APOE, BMP8, GNRHR and OXTR, while inconsistent associations with the single FL structure trait and backfat were observed for other genes. This study suggests that in some cases there may be a common genetic mechanism or linked genes regulating fatness and leg weakness. Such relationships are clearly complex, and the utilization of genetic markers associated with both traits should be treated cautiously.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mathew, Joseph L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Timing of umbilical cord clamping in term and preterm deliveries and infant and maternal outcomes: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials</title><secondary-title>Indian Pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Indian Pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>123-129</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21378422</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13312-011-0031-z</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>RELEVANCE Active management of the third stage of labor (comprising administration of a uterotonic agent, cord clamping and cutting, and controlled cord traction) has supplanted the 'physiological' (non-interventionist) approach [1]; as a consequence the umbilical cord is usually clamped soon after delivery of the baby. The observation that the cord can contain up to 20 mL of blood [2] raised the possibility of delaying clamping to allow placental transfusion to the baby. One of the major advantages could be to increase the circulating volume and hemoglobin level. The benefits of the former include less respiratory distress and reduced need for later transfusions [3,4]. Increasing the hemoglobin level and iron stores is attractive because anemia in early infancy is a frequent problem, especially in developing countries. However these potential benefits need to be balanced against possible harmful effects, for the mother (postpartum hemorrhage and its consequences) [1,5,6] and infant (delayed resuscitation, hypothermia, polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia and risk of intraventricular hemorrhage). The issue is complicated by the fact that term babies, preterm babies and very premature babies could behave as different cohorts, making it difficult to develop an empiric guideline for timing of cord clamping across all gestations. This systematic review explores the question: Does delayed cord clamping (intervention) at delivery, improve maternal and infant (population), short-term and long-term outcomes (outcome), compared to early cord clamping (comparator)? for randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing delayed cord clamping (DCC) defined as &gt;30 seconds following delivery, versus early cord clamping (ECC) defined as within 30 seconds of delivery; reporting maternal and/or infant outcomes. The final updated search on 16 December 2010 in the Cochrane Library (search term &quot; cord clamp &quot; and filter &quot; Record title &quot;) yielded 3 Cochrane systematic reviews (CSR), 5 other systematic reviews, and 71 trials. Medline search on the same date (search term: cord clamping; limits: randomized controlled trial, meta-analysis) yielded 137 citations. The available systematic reviews [7-12] were either outdated and/or had methodological limitations. A total of 57 publications were short-listed as potentially relevant. Thirty were excluded for the following reasons: not RCT comparing DCC vs ECC (n=6), RCT but intervention in either arm not according to definition of DCC or ECC (n=4), RCT but intervention in control arm not described (n=1), outcome not of interest (n=2), publications as editorials, correspondence or commentaries (n=6), outdated systematic reviews (n=6), only abstract available without data (n=5). Overall, 29 trial reports -15 in term and 14 in preterm deliveries comprise current best evidence (Table I); this includes two additional trials identified through searching of bibliography of short-listed publications [23] and recent conference proceedings [27].</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sant'Anna, A.

The fl ight speed (FS) of 7,402 yearling animals was measured, using a device composed of a pair of photoelectric cells. Time interval data (s) were converted to speed (m/s) and faster animals were regarded as more reactive. The growth traits analyzed were weaning weight (WW), ADG from weaning to yearling age, and yearling scrotal circumference (SC). The (co)variance components were estimated using REML in a multitrait analysis applying an animal model. The model included random direct additive genetic and residual effects, fi xed effects of contemporary groups, age of dam (classes), and age of animal as covariable. For WW, the model also included maternal genetic and permanent environmental random effects. The direct heritability estimate for FS was 0.26 ¬± 0.05 and direct heritability estimates for WW, SC, and ADG were 0.30 ¬± 0.01, 0.48 ¬± 0.02, and 0.19 ¬± 0.01, respectively. Estimates of the genetic correlation between FS and the growth traits were -0.12 ¬± 0.07 (WW), ‚Äì0.13 ¬± 0.08 (ADG), and ‚Äì0.11 ¬± 0.07 (SC). Although the values were low, these correlations showed that animals with better temperaments (slower FS) tended to present better performance. It is possible to infer that long- term selection for weight and scrotal circumference can promote a positive genetic response in the temperament of animals. Nevertheless, to obtain faster genetic progress in temperament, it would be necessary to perform direct selection for such trait. Flight speed is an easily measured indicator of temperament and can be included as a selection criterion in breeding programs for Nellore cattle.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>ElGhazaly, Tarek</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automatic text classification using neural network and statistical approaches</title><secondary-title>Studies in Computational Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in Computational Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>351-369</pages><volume>740</volume><keywords><keyword>Automatic classification</keyword><keyword>Neural network classifier</keyword><keyword>Statistical classifier</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>978-3-319-67056-0</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-67056-0_17</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Automatic Classification is crucial for text retrieval, knowledge management, and decision making as it converts text from raw data to a real knowledge. In this paper, Text Automatic Classification has been introduced starting from improved methods for the preprocessing algorithms that are common to the different classifiers, then enhanced algorithms for two different classifiers: a Statistical one and a Neural Network based one. The preprocessing algorithm included words features extraction, stop words removal, and enhanced word stemming. For the statistical classifier, weighting techniques have been introduced to enhance the statistical classification concluding that the combination of the Term Frequence X Inverse Document Frequency (TFxIDF) and the Category Frequency (CF) gives the highest classification. For the neural network based classifier, a classification model has been proposed using an artificial neural network trained by the Back propagation learning algorithm. Due to the high dimensionality of the feature space typical for textual data, scalability is poor if the neural network is trained using this high dimensional raw data. In order to improve the scalability of the proposed model, four dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed to reduce the feature space into an input space of much lower dimension for the neural network classifier. The first three of these techniques are domain dependent term selection methods: the Document Frequency (DF) method, the Category Frequency- Document Frequency (CF-DF) method and the TFxIDF method. The fourth technique is a domain independent feature extraction method based on a statistical multivariate data analysis technique which is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) an this technique was the best as per the done experiments. The proposed classifiers have been tested through experiments conducted using a subset of the Reuters-21,758 test collection for text classification. Although this paper considered English as the language under research to make use of the standard Reuters-21,758, the proposed model could be used for other languages.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tuma, J.

Studies on rodent fl-cells have suggested a role for GLUT2 and glucokinase in this control function and in mechanisms leading to diabetes. Little direct evidence exists so far to implicate these two proteins in glucose recog-nition by human (3-cells. The present in vitro study investi-gates the role of glucose transport and phosphorylation in fl-cell preparations from nondiabetic human pancreata. Hu-man fl-cells differ from rodent f8-cells in glucose transporter gene expression (predominantly GLUT1 instead of GLUT2), explaining their low K. (3 mmol/liter) and low V m^x (3 mmol/min per liter) for 3-0-methyl glucose trans-port. The 100-fold lower GLUT2 abundance in human ver-sus rat fl-cells is associated with a 10-fold slower uptake of alloxan, explaining their resistance to this rodent diabeto-genic agent. Human and rat f-cells exhibit comparable glu-cokinase expression with similar flux-generating influence on total glucose utilization. These data underline the impor-tance of glucokinase but not of GLUT2 in the glucose sensor of human fl-cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thies, Judy A</author><author>Basigalup, Daniel</author><author>Barnes, Donald K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inheritance of Resistance to Pratylenchus penetrans in Alfalfa</title><secondary-title>Journal of Nematology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Nematology</full-title></periodical><pages>452-459</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1994</year></dates><accession-num>19279915</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.fcla.edu/jon/article/view/66649%5Cnhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2619523</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Fifty-two alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) clones, randomly selected from the cultivar Baker and the experimental line MNGRN-4, were evaluated for resistance (based on nematode reproduction) to Pratylenchus penetrans in growth chamber tests (25 C). Twenty-five clones, representing the range of nematodes and eggs per plant, were selected and retested. Four moderately resistant and two susceptible alfalfa clones were identified. Inheritance of resistance to P. penetrans was studied in these six clones using a diallel mating design. The S, Fl, and reciprocal progenies differed for numbers of nematodes and eggs per g dry root and for shoot and root weights (P &lt; 0.05). Resistance, measured as numbers of nematodes in roots, was correlated between parental clones and their S families (r = 0.94), parental clones and their half-sib families (r = 0.81), and S and half-sib families (r = 0.88). General combining ability (GCA) effects were significant for nematode resistance traits. Both GCA and specific combining ability (SCA) effects were significant for plant size traits, but SCA was more important than GCA in predicting progeny plant size. Reciprocal effects were significant for both nematode resistance and plant size traits, which may slow selection progress in long-term selection programs. However, the GCA effects are large enough that breeding procedures that capitalize on additive effects should be effective in developing alfalfa cultivars with resistance to P. penetrans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mandl, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tolerantes Information Retrieval - Neuronale Netze zur Erh√∂hung der Adaptivit√§t und Flexibilit√§t bei der Informationssuche</title><secondary-title>Schriften zur Informationswissenschaft</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Schriften zur Informationswissenschaft</full-title></periodical><volume>39</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><urls/><abstract>definition information retrieval  p 9: definition soft computing (Lofti Zadeh): soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that, unlike hard computing, it is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth.  p 11: text retrieval. Advantages and disadvantages. - Manual indexing: person assigns keyword to document. Also keywords that might not appear in text. Limited indexing vocabulary.

Pair (query - document). Uses Bayes equation for more than one terms for relevance. (quite abstract)  - context vector: maps all terms onto a vector of basic properties with some weights (indexinig of terms with predefined vocabulary). Might be used for disambiguation. Manual assignment done once. Summary of all vector elements for all terms in a document, which is shorter as all original terms of a document. - neuronal nets (also called backpropagation network) - compression method. Learn functions from one space to another using training examples and a hidden layer. Hidden layer is a reduced representation from which the complete vector is retrieved. Learns to reproduce input in output. - latent semantic indexing (LSI). Compression of document-term matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD). Works similar as factor analysis: simplification of correlation matrix between &quot;Merkmalen&quot; (of documents ?). Creates orthogonal factors. LSI makes use of spare document-term matrices, which gives two matrices: reduced term space and reduced document space.

Backpropagation networks do not use if-then rules, but many examples of symptoms-decision pairs. Consists of input-hidden layer-output layer with weighted layers in-between. Learning is done by reducing the errors for a given example through changing weights of connections. Done for all examples. Recursively until the network has learned the desired functions.

Hopfield model fills all fields in matrix. Some models group neurons in layers, with no links within layers. Use of uni- or bidirectional.Backpropagation uses uni-directional. Positive and negative weights possible.  learning rules: The mapping from input to output in activation function is changed through learning.  - supervised (&quot;teacher&quot; checks result and compares them to desired result). using Delta rules. A neural net that uses this rule is known as a perceptron, and this rule is called the perceptron learning rule. - unsupervised (net analyses data itself), e.g., Hebb's Rule (use it or lose it) - reinforcement learning (in-between)    Neural networks can be classified as either pattern-classifiers or pattern-associators. Pattern-classifiers take an input vector and output a value that can be used to classify it. For example, taking a sonar signal and classifying it as either a rock or a mine. Perceptrons and Adaline networks are examples of such classifiers. A pattern-associator network is a net that takes a given input vector and outputs another vector.  There are two types of associative networks, hetero-associative (HA) and auto-associative (AA). Hetero-associative takes an input vector and outputs a completely different vector.

To calculate this upper bound, use the number of  cases in the training data set and divide that number by the sum of the number of nodes in the input and output layers in the network. Then divide that result again by a scaling factor between five and ten. Larger scaling factors are used for relatively less noisy data. If you use too many artificial neurons the training set will be memorized.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley.enl" path="mendeley.enl">mendeley.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stone, Lynley</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Powering Search: The Role of Thesauri in New Information Environments</title><secondary-title>Library Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Library Review</full-title></periodical><pages>620-621</pages><volume>62</volume><keywords><keyword>Controlled vocabularies</keyword><keyword>Information retrieval</keyword><keyword>Thesauri</keyword><keyword>User interface design</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>9783848215430</isbn><accession-num>502955140</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1108/LR-05-2013-0059</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Powering Search: The Role of Thesauri in New Information Environments, a title published in the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T) Monograph Series, is a bold attempt to lay a foundation for thesauri use and integration with search interfaces: pulling together research, scholarship, and development from across broadly divergent areas. The author, Ali Shiri, is associate professor of Library and Information Studies at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and holds a doctorate in information science in addition to bachelor's and master's degrees in library and information science. Further adding to his credentials, the author has published extensively on thesaurus-enhanced user search interfaces in academic journal literature. The monograph delivers a treatment that is part extended scholarly article and part textbook targeted at students in courses of information science and technology. The first several chapters present perhaps the most thorough treatment and background of theoretical underpinnings of the topic that this reviewer has seen to-date. Throughout, the text adheres closely to a pattern of literature review, followed by presentation of examples, and instructional critique. It is in the presentation and critique of examples that the hardcover edition reviewed shows weakness; the text would have benefited from a decision to include the numerous illustrative snapshots of search interfaces as color plates rather than and black and white figures. Color is a significant aspect of interface design and usability, and is unfortunately lost in the print edition; it is to be hoped that the newly available electronic book edition of the book doesn't share the same flaw. The organization of the text is straightforward, building from a thorough introduction to the concept of thesauri, through interactive information retrieval, to user-centered approach, including query formulation and expansion; a pattern that is then repeated in more depth with a focus on web-based search. The second half of the book is focused primarily on design matters, and builds from methodologies for user evaluation to design guidelines and current trends and developments. Each of the ten chapters of the text closes with a References section, keeping them immediately to hand; a feature that will no doubt be appreciated by scholar and researcher alike. It bears mention, however, that the overall focus never strays far from traditional library practice; given the pervasive use of thesauri-enhanced search engines outside of that realm, it would have been nice to hear the author's insights as to the rapidly evolving mechanisms behind their operation and their potential import to library search interfaces. Powering Search provides a thorough treatment of the topic, and earns a rightful place on the shelf of the researcher as well as that of the practitioner; librarians and information science professionals unfamiliar with the topic may find it to be of particular use. The author has delivered on a much-needed overview of thesauri across the landscape of traditional library practice, and a solid step in the direction of a unified treatment overall; academic libraries and those supporting programs of library and information sciences would do well to consider adding the title to their collection.

Worldwide bond strength tests are used to evaluate bonding effectiveness of different adhesive techniques. The purpose of this study was to systematically collect these data to identify the primary parameters that affect the outcome of bond strength tests, and to attempt to disclose trends in adhesive performance of the different adhesive approaches today available. Materials and Methods. 871 studies were identified by entering the search term ‚Äòdentin bond strength AND ‚Äúpublished last 5 years‚Äù[Filter]‚Äô in PubMed, and subsequently inserted in a custom-made database. Only studies containing data on the adhesion of several commercial adhesives to dentin were retained. Besides the actual bond strength data (mean, SD, n and number of pre-testing failures), other relevant parameters were recorded with regard to the substrate bonded to, surface preparation, storage conditions, potential artificial ageing, alternative application techniques, type of composite used, and some specific test conditions. Results. Up to now, 328 studies have been evaluated and from 110 studies relevant data were extracted, yielding 961 individual bond strength tests. A relatively simple statistical general linear model was generated to identify relevant parameters. The bond strength test used most often was the micro-tensile bond strength test (ŒºTBS: 67%), followed by the macro-shear (MSB: 18%), micro-shear (ŒºSB: 9%), macro-tensile (MTB: 4%) and push-out bond strength test (PoB: 2%). For further analysis, the push-out bond strengths and the adhesives that had been tested in less than 3 studies were excluded. From the remaining data, 56% involved any kind of experimental parameter as artificial aging, altered application techniques, etc. The actual bond strength obtained was significantly affected by the type of test employed (on average 29.2 and 18.1 MPa for ŒºTBS and MSB respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). Significant differences were also observed for the different adhesive classes (pooled data): three-step etch&amp;rinse (mean ¬± 95% confidence interval: 36.9 ¬± 5.8, n = 44;), two-step etch&amp;rinse (26.3 ¬± 1.7, n = 178), two-step self-etch (32.3 ¬± 2, n = 163) and one-step self-etch adhesives (23.6 ¬± 1.4, n = 253). Also between individual adhesives substantial differences were observed in the mean bond strengths, ranging from 49 MPa (OptiBond Fl, Kerr) to 10 MPa (Futurabond NR, Voco). About 36% of the groups involved any kind of artificial aging and this affected the outcome significantly (22.5 MPa versus 27 MPa for the control specimens, p &lt; 0.001). Another remarkable parameter was the flexural modulus of the composite used; a lower flexural modulus was significantly correlated with lower bond strengths. Conclusions. Although preliminary, this systematic analysis of the bond strength data in literature revealed some key parameters that affect the outcome of bond strength tests.</abstract></record></records></xml>

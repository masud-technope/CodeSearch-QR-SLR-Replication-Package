      <dc:description>
Summary
In the era of edge computing, real?time data preprocessing on the edge node has the potential to improve computational efficiency and data accuracy. However, a significant challenge is private data disclosure, particularly in the case of location?based services. To address this challenge, in this paper, by leveraging differential privacy, we propose a privacy?aware framework for mobile edge computing called MEPA to protect the location privacy in which the edge node is regarded as an anonymous central server. The proposed framework can provide computing services without deploying special infrastructure. To be specific, in order to solve the problem of constrained computing resources in the edge nodes, the algorithm of Quadtree Differential Privacy based on Hilbert curve division (QTDP?H) two?dimensional spatial data query transmission is proposed. First, a noise quadtree is established and the privacy budget is divided according to the tree level. Then, the constructed quadtree is represented by quanternary, so that the partition based on Hilbert curve can be established and the two?dimensional data in the area can be converted into one?dimensional, which can greatly improve the retrieval efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of time complexity and retrieval accuracy has been verified by extensive experimental results. Compared with traditional methods of (D,?)???LP, the average runtime can be reduced by 15%?20%, and the average relative error is reduced by 20%.

      <rss:title>Query expansion based on statistical learning from code changes</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Summary
Thesaurus?based, code?related, and software?specific query expansion techniques are the main contributions in free?form query search. However, these techniques still could not put the most relevant query result in the first position because they lack the ability to infer the expansion words that represent the user needs based on a given query. In this paper, we discover that code changes can imply what users want and propose a novel query expansion technique with code changes (QECC). It exploits (changes, contexts) pairs from changed methods. On the basis of statistical learning from pairs, it can infer code changes for a given query. In this way, it expands a query with code changes and recommends the query results that meet actual needs perfectly. In addition, we implement InstaRec to perform QECC and evaluate it with 195?039 change commits from GitHub and our code tracker. The results show that QECC can improve the precision of 3 code search algorithms (ie, IR, Portfolio, and VF) by up to 52% to 62% and outperform the state?of?the?art query expansion techniques (ie, query expansion based on crowd knowledge and CodeHow) by 13% to 16% when the top 1 result is inspected.

      <rss:title>Visualizing Expanded Query Results</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
When performing queries in web search engines, users often face difficulties choosing appropriate query terms. Search engines therefore usually suggest a list of expanded versions of the user query to disambiguate it or to resolve potential term mismatches. However, it has been shown that users find it difficult to choose an expanded query from such a list. In this paper, we describe the adoption of set?based text visualization techniques to visualize how query expansions enrich the result space of a given user query and how the result sets relate to each other. Our system uses a linguistic approach to expand queries and topic modeling to extract the most informative terms from the results of these queries. In a user study, we compare a common text list of query expansion suggestions to three set?based text visualization techniques adopted for visualizing expanded query results – namely, Compact Euler Diagrams, Parallel Tag Clouds, and a List View – to resolve ambiguous queries using interactive query expansion. Our results show that text visualization techniques do not increase retrieval efficiency, precision, or recall. Overall, users rate Parallel Tag Clouds visualizing key terms of the expanded query space lowest. Based on the results, we derive recommendations for visualizations of query expansion results, text visualization techniques in general, and discuss alternative use cases of set?based text visualization techniques in the context of web search.

      <rss:title>Toward an anatomy of IR system component performances</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Information retrieval (IR) systems are the prominent means for searching and accessing huge amounts of unstructured information on the web and elsewhere. They are complex systems, constituted by many different components interacting together, and evaluation is crucial to both tune and improve them. Nevertheless, in the current evaluation methodology, there is still no way to determine how much each component contributes to the overall performances and how the components interact together. This hampers the possibility of a deep understanding of IR system behavior and, in turn, prevents us from designing ahead which components are best suited to work together for a specific search task. In this paper, we move the evaluation methodology one step forward by overcoming these barriers and beginning to devise an “anatomy” of IR systems and their internals. In particular, we propose a methodology based on the General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to develop statistical models able to isolate system variance and component effects as well as their interaction, by relying on a grid of points (GoP) containing all the combinations of the analyzed components. We apply the proposed methodology to the analysis of two relevant search tasks—news search and web search—by using standard TREC collections. We analyze the basic set of components typically part of an IR system, namely, stop lists, stemmers, and n?grams, and IR models. In this way, we derive insights about English text retrieval.

      <rss:title>Modeling multiple interactions with a Markov random field in query expansion for session search</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
How to automatically understand and answer users' questions (eg, queries issued to a search engine) expressed with natural language has become an important yet difficult problem across the research fields of information retrieval and artificial intelligence. In a typical interactive Web search scenario, namely, session search, to obtain relevant information, the user usually interacts with the search engine for several rounds in the forms of, eg, query reformulations, clicks, and skips. These interactions are usually mixed and intertwined with each other in a complex way. For the ideal goal, an intelligent search engine can be seen as an artificial intelligence agent that is able to infer what information the user needs from these interactions. However, there still exists a big gap between the current state of the art and this goal. In this paper, in order to bridge the gap, we propose a Markov random field–based approach to capture dependence relations among interactions, queries, and clicked documents for automatic query expansion (as a way of inferring the information needs of the user). An extensive empirical evaluation is conducted on large?scale web search data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models.

      <rss:title>Automated email answering by text?pattern matching: Performance and error analysis</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Automated answering of frequent email inquiries can be implemented as a text categorization task with narrow text categories, where all messages in 1 text category have the same answer. Such email categorization should be optimized for high precision and at least acceptable recall. One such high?precision email categorization method is matching of surface text patterns to incoming email messages. In order to assess the upper performance limits of text?pattern matching, we conducted extensive tests with almost 10,000 messages. Our results show that automated email answering with precision around 90% and recall 50–75% is feasible. In order to achieve this, however, the system must work with multiword expressions rather than stand?alone words. Furthermore, we argue that the system has to distinguish the context of an email inquiry from the actual need that created the inquiry—a question, request, or complaint. We have discovered and analysed 12 reasons why text?pattern matching may fail.

      <rss:title>Impact of structural weighting on a latent Dirichlet allocation–based feature location technique</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Text retrieval–based feature location techniques (FLTs) use information from the terms present in documents in classes and methods. However, relevant terms originating from certain locations (eg, method names) often comprise only a small part of the entire method lexicon. Feature location techniques should benefit from techniques that make greater use of this information. The primary objective of this study was to investigate how weighting terms from different locations in source code can improve a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)?based FLT. We conducted an empirical study of 4 subject software systems and 372 features. For each subject system, we trained 1024 different LDA models with new weighting schemes applied to leading comments, method names, parameters, body comments, and local variables. We conducted both a quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify the effects of using the weighting schemes on the performance of the LDA?based FLT. We evaluated weighting schemes based on mean reciprocal rank and spread of effectiveness measures. In addition, we conducted a factorial analysis to identify which locations have a main impact on the results of the FLT. We then examined the effects of adding information from class comments, class names, and fields to the top 10 configurations for each system. This results in an additional 640 different LDA models for each system. From our results, we identified a significant effect in the performance of an LDA?based weighting configuration when applying our weighting schemes to the LDA?based FLT. Furthermore, we found that adding information from each method's containing class can improve the effectiveness of an LDA?based FLT. Finally, we identified a set of recommendations for identifying better weighting schemes for LDA.

      <rss:title>Mining unit test cases to synthesize API usage examples</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Software developers study and reuse existing source code to understand how to properly use application programming interfaces (APIs). However, manually finding sufficient and adequate code examples for a given API is a difficult and a time?consuming activity. Existing approaches to find or generate examples assume availability of a reasonable set of client code that uses the API. This assumption does not hold for newly released API libraries, non?widely used APIs, nor private ones.
In this work we reuse the important information that is naturally present in test code to circumvent the lack of usage examples for an API when other sources of client code are not available. We propose an approach for automatically identifying the most representative API uses within each unit test case. We then develop an approach to synthesize API usage examples by extracting relevant statements representing the usage of such APIs. We compare the output of a prototype implementation of our approach to both human?written examples and to a state?of?the?art approach. The obtained results are encouraging; the examples automatically generated with our approach are superior to the state?of?the?art approach and highly similar to the manually constructed examples.

      <rss:title>TMAP: Discovering relevant API methods through text mining of API documentation</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Developers often migrate their applications to support various platform/programming?language application programming interfaces (APIs) to retain existing users and to attract new users. To migrate an application written using 1 API (source) to another API (target), a developer must know how the methods in the source API map to the methods in the target API. Given that a typical platform or language exposes a large number of API methods, manually discovering API mappings is prohibitively resource?intensive and may be error prone. The goal of this research is to support software developers in migrating an application from a source API to a target API by automatically discovering relevant method mappings across APIs using text mining on the natural language API method descriptions. This paper proposes text mining based approach (TMAP) to discover relevant API mappings. To evaluate our approach, we used TMAP to discover API mappings for 15 classes across (1) Java and C# API; and (2) Java ME and Android API. We compared the discovered mappings with state?of?the?art source code analysis?based approaches: Rosetta and StaMiner. Our results indicate that TMAP on average found relevant mappings for 56% and 57% more methods compared to the Rosetta and the StaMiner approaches, respectively.

      <rss:title>Ontology?Based Representation and Modelling of Synthetic 3D Content: A State?of?the?Art Review</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
An indispensable element of any practical 3D/VR/AR application is synthetic three?dimensional (3D) content. Such content is characterized by a variety of features—geometry, structure, space, appearance, animation and behaviour—which makes the modelling of 3D content a much more complex, difficult and time?consuming task than in the case of other types of content. One of the promising research directions aiming at simplification of modelling 3D content is the use of the semantic web approach. The formalism provided by semantic web techniques enables declarative knowledge?based modelling of content based on ontologies. Such modelling can be conducted at different levels of abstraction, possibly domain?specific, with inherent separation of concerns. The use of semantic web ontologies enables content representation independent of particular presentation platforms and facilitates indexing, searching and analysing content, thus contributing to increased content re?usability. A range of approaches have been proposed to permit semantic representation and modelling of synthetic 3D content. These approaches differ in the methodologies and technologies used as well as their scope and application domains. This paper provides a review of the current state of the art in representation and modelling of 3D content based on semantic web ontologies, together with a classification, characterization and discussion of the particular approaches.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Large amounts of medical visual data are produced in hospitals daily and made available continuously via publications in the scientific literature, representing the medical knowledge. However, it is not always easy to find the desired information and in clinical routine the time to fulfil an information need is often very limited. Information retrieval systems are a useful tool to provide access to these documents/images in the biomedical literature related to information needs of medical professionals. Shangri–La is a medical retrieval system that can potentially help clinicians to make decisions on difficult cases. It retrieves articles from the biomedical literature when querying a case description and attached images. The system is based on a multimodal retrieval approach with a focus on the integration of visual information connected to text. The approach includes a query–adaptive multimodal fusion criterion that analyses if visual features are suitable to be fused with text for the retrieval. Furthermore, image modality information is integrated in the retrieval step. The approach is evaluated using the ImageCLEFmed 2013 medical retrieval benchmark and can thus be compared to other approaches. Results show that the final approach outperforms the best multimodal approach submitted to ImageCLEFmed 2013.

      <rss:title>Learning to reformulate long queries for clinical decision support</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
The large volume of biomedical literature poses a serious problem for medical professionals, who are often struggling to keep current with it. At the same time, many health providers consider knowledge of the latest literature in their field a key component for successful clinical practice. In this work, we introduce two systems designed to help retrieving medical literature. Both receive a long, discursive clinical note as input query, and return highly relevant literature that could be used in support of clinical practice. The first system is an improved version of a method previously proposed by the authors; it combines pseudo relevance feedback and a domain?specific term filter to reformulate the query. The second is an approach that uses a deep neural network to reformulate a clinical note. Both approaches were evaluated on the 2014 and 2015 TREC CDS datasets; in our tests, they outperform the previously proposed method by up to 28% in inferred NDCG; furthermore, they are competitive with the state of the art, achieving up to 8% improvement in inferred NDCG.

      <rss:title>What makes an effective clinical query and querier?</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
In this paper, we perform an in?depth study into how clinicians represent their information needs and the influence this has on information retrieval (IR) effectiveness. While much research in IR has considered the effectiveness of IR systems, there is still a significant gap in the understanding of how users contribute to the effectiveness of these systems. The paper aims to contribute to this by studying how clinicians search for information. Multiple representations of an information need—from verbose patient case descriptions to ad?hoc queries—were considered in order to understand their effect on retrieval. Four clinicians provided queries and performed relevance assessment to form a test collection used in this study. The different query formulation strategies of each clinician, and their effectiveness, were investigated. The results show that query formulation had more impact on retrieval effectiveness than the particular retrieval systems used. The most effective queries were short, ad?hoc keyword queries. Different clinicians were observed to consistently adopt specific query formulation strategies. The most effective queriers were those who, given their information need, inferred novel keywords most likely to appear in relevant documents. This study reveals aspects of how people search within the clinical domain. This can help inform the development of new models and methods that specifically focus on the query formulation process to improve retrieval effectiveness.

      <rss:title>Users and uses of a global union catalog: A mixed?methods study of WorldCat.org</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
This paper presents the first large?scale investigation of the users and uses of WorldCat.org, the world's largest bibliographic database and global union catalog. Using a mixed?methods approach involving focus group interviews with 120 participants, an online survey with 2,918 responses, and an analysis of transaction logs of approximately 15 million sessions from WorldCat.org, the study provides a new understanding of the context for global union catalog use. We find that WorldCat.org is accessed by a diverse population, with the three primary user groups being librarians, students, and academics. Use of the system is found to fall within three broad types of work?task (professional, academic, and leisure), and we also present an emergent taxonomy of search tasks that encompass known?item, unknown?item, and institutional information searches. Our results support the notion that union catalogs are primarily used for known?item searches, although the volume of traffic to WorldCat.org means that unknown?item searches nonetheless represent an estimated 250,000 sessions per month. Search engine referrals account for almost half of all traffic, but although WorldCat.org effectively connects users referred from institutional library catalogs to other libraries holding a sought item, users arriving from a search engine are less likely to connect to a library.

      <rss:title>RESeED: A secure regular?expression search tool for storage clouds</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Summary
Lack of trust has become one of the main concerns of users who tend to utilize one or multiple Cloud providers. Trustworthy Cloud?based computing and data storage require secure and efficient solutions which allow clients to remotely store and process their data in the Cloud. User?side encryption is an established method to secure the user data on the Cloud. However, using encryption, we lose processing capabilities, such as searching, over the Cloud data. In this paper, we present RESeED, a tool that provides user?transparent and Cloud?agnostic regular?expression search functionality over encrypted data across multiple Clouds. Upon a client's intent to upload a new document to the Cloud, RESeED analyzes the document's content and updates its data structures accordingly. Then, it encrypts and transfers the document to the Cloud. RESeED provides the regular?expression search functionality over encrypted data by translating the search queries on?the?fly to finite automata and analyzing concise and secure representations of the data before asking the Cloud to download the encrypted documents. RESeED's parallel architecture enables efficient search over large?scale (and potentially big data scale) data?sets. We evaluate the performance of RESeED experimentally and demonstrate its scalability and correctness using real?world data?sets from arXiv.org and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Our results show that RESeED produces accurate query responses with a reasonable (?6%) storage overhead. The results also demonstrate that for many search queries, RESeED performs faster in compare with the grep utility that functions on unencrypted data. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

      <rss:title>A protocol?driven approach to automatically finding authoritative answers to consumer health questions in online resources</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
The purpose of this research was to establish an upper bound on finding answers to health?related questions in MedlinePlus and other online resources. Seven reference librarians tested a set of protocols to determine whether it was possible to use the types and foci of the questions extracted from customer requests submitted to the National Library of Medicine to find authoritative answers to these questions. Librarians tested the protocols manually to determine if the process was sufficiently robust and accurate to later automate. Results indicated that the extracted terms provide enough information to find authoritative answers for about 60% of questions and that certain question types are more likely to result in authoritative answers than others. The question corpus and analysis performed for this project will inform automatic question answering systems, and could lead to suggestions for new content to include in MedlinePlus. This approach can serve as an example to researchers interested in methods of evaluating question answering tools and the contents of online databases.

      <rss:title>Analysis of change in users' assessment of search results over time</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
We present the first systematic study of the influence of time on user judgements for rankings and relevance grades of web search engine results. The goal of this study is to evaluate the change in user assessment of search results and explore how users' judgements change. To this end, we conducted a large?scale user study with 86 participants who evaluated 2 different queries and 4 diverse result sets twice with an interval of 2 months. To analyze the results we investigate whether 2 types of patterns of user behavior from the theory of categorical thinking hold for the case of evaluation of search results: (a) coarseness and (b) locality. To quantify these patterns we devised 2 new measures of change in user judgements and distinguish between local (when users swap between close ranks and relevance values) and nonlocal changes. Two types of judgements were considered in this study: (a) relevance on a 4?point scale, and (b) ranking on a 10?point scale without ties. We found that users tend to change their judgements of the results over time in about 50% of cases for relevance and in 85% of cases for ranking. However, the majority of these changes were local.

      <rss:title>Detecting temporal patterns of user queries</rss:title>
      <dc:description>
Query classification is an important part of exploring the characteristics of web queries. Existing studies are mainly based on Broder's classification scheme and classify user queries into navigational, informational, and transactional categories according to users' information needs. In this article, we present a novel classification scheme from the perspective of queries' temporal patterns. Queries' temporal patterns are inherent time series patterns of the search volumes of queries that reflect the evolution of the popularity of a query over time. By analyzing the temporal patterns of queries, search engines can more deeply understand the users' search intents and thus improve performance. Furthermore, we extract three groups of features based on the queries' search volume time series and use a support vector machine (SVM) to automatically detect the temporal patterns of user queries. Extensive experiments on the Million Query Track data sets of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
